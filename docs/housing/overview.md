# Housing

This chapter lays the foundation for the vision, goals, and policies that will direct Nederland's future as it relates to housing. This chapter describes current housing conditions and future housing needs as well as opportunities to increase the supply of housing to meet the needs of current and future residents. The concepts in this chapter were developed through conversations with stakeholders about the needs of the community, an analysis of current market conditions, the 2023 Town of Nederland Housing Needs Assessment, and public input on the priorities of the town and desired character of the community. The recommended strategies identified in this chapter are informed by research on national and state best practices with sensitivity towards a small town, rural context. The recommendations that follow are considered alongside the Town of Nederland's goals for sustainable growth, development of more affordable housing, and preserving the rustic and eclectic mountain town.

## Housing Vision Statement

> "Housing meets the social, economic, and environmental needs of the community through sustainable development. We encourage housing that enhances community by supporting the housing needs of local workers and residents. New housing positively contributes to, and respects, the character and style of existing architecture and neighborhoods while allowing residents of all ages, incomes and abilities the opportunity to live with dignity in our community."
