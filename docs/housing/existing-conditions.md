# Existing Conditions & Key Issues

## Setting the Context

Population growth has remained steady from 2000-2022 throughout the State of Colorado, growing from 4.2 million people to 5.8 million people, with an average annual growth rate of 1.5%, nearly double the US national rate of 0.8%. From 2008-2018, the construction of new housing units did not keep pace with population growth due to the impacts of the Great Recession on the housing market. In recent history, housing units have developed at a much higher rate, with the State of Colorado adding an estimated 180,000 housing units between 2018 and 2022 while the state population increased by 161,000 over the same time. While the rate of housing production is trending upwards, the hiatus of housing development between 2008-2018 left most of the State with an undersupply of housing relative to the increase in demand for new homes.

In addition to an undersupply of current housing stock around the State, there are several socio-economic factors outside the purview of government that affect the housing market. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the global supply chain and drove up the cost of construction materials and inflation following the COVID-19 pandemic has driven up interest rates. Mountain communities already struggle with higher costs of construction materials and a lower availability of construction workers under normal market conditions and the cost of building new homes in rural mountain communities can often face added challenges such as environmental concerns, topographic constraints, and land availability. Meanwhile, since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, mountain communities across the American West have seen an influx of remote workers from more expensive cities who are choosing to relocate to mountain communities for increased access to recreation and outdoor amenities, and a desire for more small town living, which is driving up housing prices more rapidly than any other region in the United States.

These larger sociological and demographic changes, coupled with Nederland's charming town character and setting as a mountain community nestled in the foothills of Boulder County in the Denver Metropolitan area have placed new challenges on the town such as rising median home prices, an influx of high-income earners skewing the area median income calculations in Nederland, and a demand for a diverse range of housing options that meet the needs of current and future residents.

## Key Issues and Opportunities

### Current Housing Stock

The 2023 Housing Needs Assessment highlighted the lack of diversity in housing type and insufficient available housing in the Town of Nederland. As of 2020, there were 720 housing units, of which 679, or 94%, are single unit detached homes. In 2020, 63% of current housing units were for-sale units whereas 37% were rental units. From 2020-2022, the Town of Nederland added roughly 44 housing units (6% increase). The US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) maintains a State of Cities Database (SOCDS) which tracks permitting trends around the Country. According to SOCDS data, the housing that was permitted in the Town of Nederland from 2012-2018 consisted primarily of single-unit housing with an average of roughly 6.5 units permitted year-over-year. Starting in 2019, the town has seen an increase in multi-unit residential developments. The Tungsten Village Boulder County Housing Authority affordable housing development was completed in 2020 and is adding needed multifamily affordable housing units to the town's housing stock.

The 2023 Town of Nederland Housing Needs Assessment calls for the town to continue to increase the diversity of the housing stock by allowing for a greater range of "missing middle housing" to meet housing affordability needs and general housing supply needs. The Housing Needs Assessment explains that given the current cost of building, the residential density "sweet spot" to entice affordable housing development is 18-20+ rental units per acre of land or 15+ ownership units per acre across Colorado. This range of units is often viewed as too dense for the Town of Nederland and may not be an appropriate target based on the town's existing development pattern and community preferences; however, this density range is recognized as the most cost-effective range of units to build to justify multifamily development. Increasing residential density decreases per-unit costs, making affordable housing development more financially feasible. This goal of continuing to diversify the housing stock does not need to happen all at once and can be managed on an ongoing basis.

The land use chapter of this comprehensive plan outlines how the town's zoning code and land use regulations could be amended to better accommodate a diversity in housing types in the future. Nederland should aim for a manageable increase in new multifamily units in a 3–5-year time frame so that the community can incrementally work out how to diversify it's housing stock. An appropriate short-range target would be to follow the Town of Nederland's commitment for Proposition 123 which would mean adding 12 units over 3 years.

### Housing Relative to Employment

The Town of Nederland has a residential population of 1,467 people. There are around 763 people employed in the town, most of whom live outside of Nederland, according to the 2022 American Community Survey. The area median income (AMI) in Nederland is $101,944 as of 2021. For comparison, the AMI of Boulder County is $92,466. According to the 2021 Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LODES) data from the US Census Bureau, less than 1% of the current residents are employed in Nederland, and more than a third of the current residents are employed outside of Nederland. Considering that less than 1% of the current residents live and work in Nederland, 34% of the current residents live in Nederland and work elsewhere, and most people employed in Nederland are commuting from outside of town, local housing prices are not grounded in the context of the local employment market.

### Affordability

The 2023 Nederland Housing Needs Assessment (HNA) highlighted affordability issues as a top concern for residents in The Town of Nederland, and that the town currently has a shortage of affordable for-sale and rental housing units. In 2020, the Median Home Price in Nederland was $496,000, just within the affordable realm for a household making over $120,000. By 2022, the American Community Survey indicated a median home price of $617,100, a 24.4% increase in two years. The HNA indicates that current median home values are around $800,000. According to the HNA, "Based on the research completed for this report, and the current average sale price in Nederland, a household looking to purchase a home in Nederland would need to expect to spend somewhere around $800,000 and such a purchase will require at least a $220,000 annual household income (Note: this is a generalized estimate and does not anticipate shifting interest rates)."

As of 2021 over 23% of the current residents are considered housing cost burdened; this may be a higher percentage of the population in 2024 as home prices have risen dramatically since 2021. According to the 2023 town of Nederland Housing Needs Assessment, 82% of homeowners making under $35,000 (or roughly 30% and under of the AMI) are paying 30% or more of their household income on housing costs. For households within the 50-80% AMI category, roughly 55% of homeowners were spending more than 30% of their household income on housing costs.

Finding affordable rent in Nederland is also challenging. The HNA found that 57% of renters with a household income of $75,000 or greater were cost-burdened by rent. Overall, 47% of households in Nederland are cost-burdened by housing, with approximately 13% being 'extremely cost-burdened,' meaning they pay more than 50% of their gross income towards housing costs.

Vacancy rates are low for rental housing in Nederland. There are affordable apartment complexes in town such as The Brown Apartments, Beaver Creek Apartments, Tungsten Village, and Prime Haven. The 6 units at Prime Haven are senior/disability designated. There are also 6 single-family style affordable units available at Rodeo Drive. The triplexes on West 3rd Street, Smurf Village, and some of the Kathmandu apartments are also generally affordable but are not officially operated as affordable housing. At the time of the HNA study in 2023, there were no vacancies available at any of these locations. The supply of market rate rental units is also relatively low on capacity.

The Brown Apartments are owned and operated by the Emergency Family Assistance Association (EFAA), where they offer temporary housing for families and seniors. The program provides intensive case management for 6-12 weeks before helping tenants transition to more permanent affordable housing through subsidies and being a liaison to find housing opportunities. A waitlist system is used to fill units as occupants transition out of The Brown Apartments.

Beaver Creek Apartments and Tungsten Village receive subsidies through the Boulder County Housing Authority and federal HOME funds, and together these properties offer 38 affordable units for low to moderate-income households. Tungsten Village rent amounts are generally $575 to $1,100 less per month than comparable market-rate units. Tungsten Village is primarily funded through federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC), which are offered to developers and housing authorities to construct and provide affordable housing to residents at rents that are lower than the market rate, serving households with income at or below 60% of Area Median Income.

### Future Housing Need

The Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) recently completed a Regional Housing Needs Assessment which examines the current and future housing needs in the Denver region. This assessment was conducted independently from the Town of Nederland's Housing Needs Assessment and used a different population survey from the Census (ACS 1-year PUMS). The Regional Housing Needs Assessment identified a need to build 115 new housing units in the Town of Nederland from 2023 to 2032. The Town of Nederland Housing Needs Assessment recommends the target of building 65-150 new rental housing units, and 50-110 new for-sale housing units centered around a phased approach. The DRCOG Regional Housing Needs assessment further includes an interactive application that quantifies the housing needs in the region to the submarket level, and jurisdictional level. The assessment further breaks down the future housing needs by the number of housing units needed at each AMI level.

**Table 6: Total Housing Unit Need (2023-2032)**

| AMI | Number of Units Needed | Percent of Total Need |
|-----|------------------------|----------------------|
| 0-30% | 54 | 47% |
| 30-60% | 26 | 23% |
| 60-80% | 7 | 6% |
| 80-100% | 11 | 10% |
| 100-120% | 4 | 3% |
| >120% | 12 | 10% |

The Regional Housing Needs Assessment, and the Town of Nederland Housing Needs Assessment should both be thought of as tools to aid the Town of Nederland in their long-term planning for housing need and should not be viewed as mutually exclusive.

## Engagement Summary

The following community input comes from the comprehensive plan open house, and the associated online survey that was open from January 23 to March 5, 2024. Further, the project team held a stakeholder meeting with the Peak-to-Peak Housing and Human Services Alliance and their associated members on February 8th, 2024.

### What Was Heard

There was agreement between attendees and respondents that there is a shortage of affordable homes for lower-income and all-income levels and a lack of long-term rentals available on the market. Most respondents felt that short-term rentals and seasonal homes contribute to the housing shortage and that the shortage is negatively affecting local businesses. When asked what other factors may be contributing to housing issues, the most popular responses were the lack of affordable units, lack of available units, and rising rents/utility costs.

When asked a series of questions regarding how the town should respond to housing needs, Open House attendees typically wanted the town to take an active and regulatory stance. Most attendees disagreed with the statement that the private market should be allowed to address housing on its own. However, survey respondents were more split on how Nederland should address housing problems. Overall, the community favored policies like land purchases, tax credits, rent subsidy programs, investment of municipal dollars, and upzoning. However, respondents were neutral on the idea of regulating the housing market to prioritize specific types of housing.

Finally, the community was asked what housing types they would like to see more of in Nederland. There was a high degree of support for most types, demonstrating a desire for housing diversity. The most supported types from the Open House were small single-family homes, deed-restricted affordable housing, accessory dwelling units, cohousing, and senior housing supporting 'aging in place.' Survey respondents showed outsized support for small single-family homes, senior housing, and ADUs. There was a resounding agreement against developing large single-family homes from the Open House and survey. Multi-unit typologies like apartments, duplexes, and townhomes all received some support from the community, but not as strongly as the previously mentioned options.

The resounding outcome of this exercise is a clear need for affordable housing and a strong community desire to work on this problem. There was a general emphasis on prioritizing infill to meet housing needs and balance sustainability goals, and a willingness to explore different housing typologies with local government taking an active lead in promoting the solution.

### Stakeholder Feedback – Needs and Opportunities

The top recommendation emerging from stakeholder conversations with Peak-to-Peak Housing and Human Services Alliance was the desire for a regional housing authority including Nederland and the entire Peak-to-Peak region, potentially also including Lyons and Idaho Springs. The existing affordable housing stock in Nederland is operated by either EFAA or the Boulder County Housing Authority (BCHA). In both cases, these groups serve greater Boulder County. In the case of BCHA, they receive federal funding so residents who access these affordable housing opportunities could be from anywhere, not specifically for current residents of Nederland. This dynamic presents a challenge to the region because they cannot plan their own affordable and workforce housing. For EFAA properties, housing is limited to applicants with direct ties to Nederland. Because of the inherent differences between the Peak-to-Peak communities and the Front Range the towns of Nederland, Lyons, Gilpin County, and Central City are working on a study to assess the feasibility of a multijurisdictional regional housing authority for the Peak-to-Peak region so that regional housing authority resources and planning are more locally applicable to these communities.

A regional housing authority could serve many functions, including reaching out to landlords and property managers, encouraging them to serve more locals and accept housing vouchers, providing mortgage assistance to buyers, assisting renters who don't have the money for a deposit, and organizing stakeholders in the Peak-to-Peak region around these objectives. Ultimately the authority could prioritize locals and the workforce housing needs of the region when units become available.

This group further emphasized the affordability crisis in Nederland, pointing out that even community roles like teachers, principals, and municipal employees are commuting due to the cost and unavailability of housing options.
