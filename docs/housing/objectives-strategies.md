# Objectives & Strategies

The following objectives and strategies are designed to help the Town of Nederland work toward its vision for housing. These objectives and strategies are informed by recent planning work, including community engagement, from The Town of Nederland, along with policies, and programs from the State of Colorado and Boulder County. Additional recommended strategies in this plan were informed by housing policy guidance from Local Housing Solutions, a non-profit housing policy platform developed to inform policy makers and local governments on a set of resources to support local housing strategies.

## Objective 1: Implement Recommendations from the 2023 Housing Needs Assessment

The 2023 Housing Needs Assessment outlined four key policy strategies. The four strategies are (1) allow small square footage residential units and smaller square footage lot sizes; (2) Develop flexibility in land occupancy requirements; (3) Increase town support and clarify procedures for the development of affordable housing development; (4) Identify opportunities to expedite the development review process for affordable housing development. The Housing Needs Assessment also included five recommendations to couple the strategies. Since the Needs Assessment was completed, the Town of Nederland has since implemented those five recommendations. However, additional recommendations from the Needs Assessment not yet implemented are outlined as actions 1 – 5 in this chapter's actions section.

## Objective 2: Leverage Opportunities from Recent State Legislation

House Bill 1271, passed in the Colorado 2021 regular house session, helped fund Nederland's Housing Needs Assessment through its local government planning grant program. In addition to planning grants, this bill creates the local government affordable housing development incentives grant program. This program allocates grants to qualifying municipalities to help them promote the development of affordable housing that is driven by community benefits and that focuses on critical housing needs as identified by the local government. Boulder County received a capacity grant and Town of Nederland staff are involved in the administration of the grant. Nederland could still be eligible to go after a capacity grant independent of the Boulder County capacity grant in the future which could be used to bolster staff bandwidth on issues related to housing by, for example, helping to fund a Housing Coordinator position. To qualify for a grant, communities must have adopted three qualifying strategies, at which point they may apply for funds to support an affordable housing development project directly or through programs that support affordable housing development or preservation in the long term.

In the 2024 legislative cycle, the State Senate passed SB 24-174 which requires each local government in the State of Colorado, beginning December 31, 2026, to conduct and publish a housing needs assessment and submit these needs assessments to the Department of Local Affairs. Further, communities in Colorado that have a population of 5,000 or greater, or a population of 1,000 or greater and are considered a rural resort community (Nederland fits this category) to submit a Housing Action Plan which is considered a separate document from the Housing Needs Assessment and is should be used to demonstrate a local government's commitment to address housing needs and that guides a local government in developing legislative actions, promoting regional coordination, and informing the public of the local government's efforts to address housing needs in the local government's jurisdiction.

In addition to the requirements outlined above, SB 24-174 further outlines that local governments will be able to access technical assistance and guidance through a grant program (administered by the Division of Local Government), the provision of consultant services, or both to aid local governments in:

- Establishing regional entities;
- Creating local and regional housing needs assessments;
- Conducting a displacement risk analysis with a state-created tool;
- Identifying and implementing strategies included in the standard affordability strategies directory, long-term affordability strategies directory, or displacement risk mitigation strategies directory;
- Making and adopting a housing action plan;
- Enacting laws and policies that encourage the development of a range of housing types, including regulated affordable housing, or mitigate the impact of displacement; and
- Creating strategic growth elements in master plans.

The act creates the continuously appropriated housing needs planning technical assistance fund to contain the money necessary for the division to provide this technical assistance and guidance. The act requires the state treasurer to transfer $10.5 million from the local government severance tax fund and $4.5 million from the local government mineral impact fund to this fund. Further, the act directs the division to serve as a clearing house for the benefit of local governments and regional entities in accomplishing the goals of the act. The Division of Local Government shall report on the assistance requested and provided under the act.

On and after December 1, 2027, for any grant program conducted by the Department of Local Affairs (DOLA), the Colorado Energy Office (CEO), the Office of Economic Development and International Trade (OEDIT), the Department of Transportation (CDOT), the Department of Natural Resources (DNR), the Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE), or the Department of Personnel and Administration that awards grants to local governments for the primary purpose of supporting land use planning or housing, the act requires the awarding entity to prioritize awarding grants to a local government that:

- Has completed and filed a housing needs assessment;
- Has adopted a housing action plan that has been accepted by the department;
- Has reported progress to the department regarding the adoption of any strategies or changes to local laws identified in the housing action plan; and
- Is the subject of a master plan that includes a water supply element and a strategic growth element.

In the 2023 State legislative cycle, the Colorado State House passed HB23-1304 (Proposition 123) which created the State Affordable Housing Fund, which dedicates 40% of funds to an affordable housing fund that is administered by DOLA and allocates the remaining 60% to the affordable housing financing fund which is administered by the Office of Economic Development and International Trade (OEDIT). Local governments can qualify to access funds from either affordable housing funding program by committing to increase existing affordable housing units by 3% each year and codifying an expedited review process for affordable housing developments. The Town of Nederland filed their commitment to Proposition 123 in October of 2023, with a baseline of 138 affordable units, committing them to adding 12 units over 3-years.

## Objective 3: Continue to Build Upon Regional Partnerships

The Boulder County Housing Authority (BCHA) is the housing authority for all areas of Boulder County outside the city limits of Longmont and Boulder, including the cities of Lafayette and Louisville, and the towns of Superior, Nederland, and Erie, and all unincorporated areas of the county. BCHA's mission is to foster the availability of quality, affordable housing, and related housing services for the residents of Boulder County. BCHA also works in partnership with the cities of Boulder and Longmont to help increase the supply and availability of affordable homes throughout these communities.

The primary program offerings from BCHA include providing affordable rentals, housing choice vouchers, rental assistance, personal finance coaching, mobile home support, and family self-sufficiency education. In the Town of Nederland, BCHA funds and operates Beaver Creek Apartments (12 units with HOME funding), Tungsten Village (26 Units with LIHTC funds), Rodeo Court (6 single-family homes), and Prime Haven (6 subsidized units where tenants pay 30% of their income towards rent). HOME funding refers to the HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME), which is a federal block grant program administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). LIHTC funds were established by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and provide tax credits to private investors in exchange for equity investments in affordable housing projects.

The Boulder County Regional Housing Partnership and its plan established a goal that 12 percent of rental and ownership housing across the region be permanently affordable for low-, moderate-, and middle-income households by 2035. This affordability goal is for the region, but many of the jurisdictions have set the same goal for themselves. The Town of Nederland has participated in this group, although the Board of Trustees (BOT) has not adopted the goal. It is uncertain whether the current BOT is aware of the goal established in 2017.

The Town of Nederland, along with neighboring communities in the Peak-to-Peak region which spans portions of Boulder, Gilpin, and Clear Creek Counties and includes Idaho Springs, Black Hawk, Central City, Allenspark, Ward, and Estes Park are in conversations about the formation of a Peak-to-Peak regional housing authority. The Peak-to-Peak Housing Authority could better serve the unique needs of the mountain communities in the Peak-to-Peak region and would help coordinate resources for these communities in an efficient manner.

## Objective 4: Create and Preserve Affordable Housing

Local governments have two primary tools for influencing the creation and preservation of affordable housing, (1) through the regulatory environment and (2) through financial support. Local governments can influence how and where affordable housing development and redevelopment occurs through their zoning code, land use regulations, and building regulations and through incentives such as expedited permitting or waived development impact fees. Zoning codes and land use regulations can further codify inclusionary requirements for affordable housing through inclusionary zoning or allowing for reduced permitting costs and approval times for affordable housing development. Several of the land use and zoning regulations recommendations that influence the town's ability to provide for new housing and more affordable housing have been covered in the Land Use Chapter of this comprehensive plan, and further elaborated as actions 1-5 in this chapter. Often affordable housing units are not produced by the market alone, and usually require subsidies from federal, state, and local governments or other creative partnerships with non-profit organizations to reduce the up-front costs of developing affordable units. Further considerations on how the town can support the development and formation of affordable housing from the financial angle are outlined as actions 7-9 in this chapter.

## Objective 5: Help Households Access and Afford Homes

During the community open house, participants voted on factors contributing to housing needs in Nederland. The factor with the most votes was rising rents and utility costs. There are several renter assistance strategies that local governments can leverage to reduce the rental barriers on residents. To help offset the impacts to housing need in the Town of Nederland related to high rental costs and instability, the Town of Nederland should consider strategies focused on rental assistance policies and programs.

Homeownership can be an important component of a household's housing and financial journey. In communities with a low stock of rental housing, homeownership can sometimes be the only solution for households that choose to remain in a community but require different housing to meet their changing needs or for households that are considering relocating to said community. For many first-time homebuyers, buying a home can be a very expensive and uncertain endeavor. The up-front costs of an initial down payment, as well as considerations regarding mortgage terms and interest rates can be barriers to homeownership for low and moderate-income households. Through a variety of different funding and regulatory programs and policies, local governments have several tools at their disposal to help households in their community make homeownership more financially attainable, reduce the barriers to homeownership for low-income households, and expand opportunities for folks looking to remain in a home. Actions 10 – 17 outlined in the next section of the Housing chapter go into greater detail on the types of funding tools and regulatory tools the Town of Nederland can leverage to help households access and afford rental and for-sale homes.

## Strategies

### Strategy 1: Affordability Considerations

The Town of Nederland could further build upon the implementation of the 2023 HNA by codifying the affordability requirements needed to receive incentive packages. These defining criteria were developed to allow the Town of Nederland to identify what types of decisions are needed to be eligible for funding opportunities to support affordable housing:

- Must serve households at or less than 100% AMI for developers to receive an incentive. For affordable housing targeting HUD funds, consider at or less than 80% AMI.
- The proportion of the units in a new development that must be set aside as affordable should range from 5-20%.
- Units must remain affordable for between 15-60 years and perhaps in perpetuity.
- Deed restrictions are an effective tool for enforcing affordability requirements.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objectives 1 and 4

### Strategy 2: Accessory Dwelling Units

The Housing Needs Assessment recommended that the Town of Nederland amend the Nederland Municipal Code to allow Accessory Dwelling Units to be constructed before primary/principal units. On December 5, 2023, the Town Board of Trustees adopted this recommendation by amending section 16-98 within Ordinance 850. A future policy recommendation includes adjusting the town Code to be even more friendly to Accessory Dwelling Units. Town should also consider allowing more than one ADU on properties that are still able to meet the yard and bulk requirements associated with the parcel's associated zoning district requirements.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objectives 1 and 4

### Strategy 3: Density Bonus Program

The HNA recommends a density bonus program, allowing for more units on a parcel of land or within a larger development in exchange for including a percentage of affordable units. Currently, Section 16-88 of the Code provides slight allowances for density bonuses in the Neighborhood Commercial District, but these provisions should be expanded to all residential zoning districts. From the HNA: "It is also recommended that Section 16-88 be transformed into a standalone section of the Nederland Municipal Code that outlines the density bonus program for each zone district and details variations in density allowances based on provided affordability considerations in development proposals." To establish this program, the town will need to define what qualifies as 'affordable' (see strategy 1) and determine the required percentage of affordable units needed to qualify for the bonus. A typical requirement for qualifying for a density bonus might be to provide 10-20% of units as affordable. This strategy aligns with DOLA's HB1271 recommendations for increasing affordable housing.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objectives 1 and 4

### Strategy 4: Expedited Development Review Process

The Housing Needs Assessment recommended that the Town of Nederland develop and adopt a new Administrative Variance ordinance for Chapter 16 of the Nederland Municipal Code which provides administrative relief and outlines an expedited process for housing developments in the Town of Nederland. Section 16-235. On December 5, 2023, a Residential Development Administrative Variance was adopted by the Board of Trustees, within Ordinance 851. In the future, the Town of Nederland could take this even further. A key theme in the HNA planning process was the need for implementing an expedited development review process with the identified goals of decreasing proposal resubmissions, decreasing review timelines, and clarifying expectations of property owners, developers, town staff, and consultants. The following steps were recommended to outline this process:

- Determine an appropriate/expedited development review timeline for affordable housing development and adopt by resolution.
- Complete a contract amendment with the town's third-party development review consultant to enforce expedited affordable housing development review requirements.
- Outline the development review process and develop a checklist to expedite housing development proposals.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objectives 1 and 4

### Strategy 5: Decrease Development Review Fees, Impact Fees, and Associated Development Fees

The Housing Needs Assessment noted that during the engagement process community members and stakeholders noted the substantial plant investment fees (PIFs) associated with housing development as a financial barrier that is difficult to navigate – and one that potentially diminishes any possibility of affordability for the subsequent housing unit renter or owner. The following fees were identified as barriers to efficient (and by extension, affordable) housing development:

- The town should consider imposing a one-time utility tap and plant investment fee based on lot size or unit size for new residential connections. This type of fee structure can incentivize smaller units and decrease the development cost of a new housing unit. This type of strategy is being evaluated under the current ongoing rate study.
- Complete the new rate study as indicated above.
- Consider a decrease or fee waiver for building and zoning-related fees for affordable housing developments. This decrease could follow the following formats:
  - Flat: Consider whether a flat monetary decrease could be targeted at 80-120% AMI housing projects.
  - Percentage: Consider a percentage decrease in fees based on the number of affordable units provided in multifamily apartments (market rate and affordable).
  - Remove the Town's fees from building permits for affordable housing developments and only charge the pass-through fee to cover consultant development review costs.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objectives 1 and 4

### Strategy 6: Implement Additional Qualifying 1271 Strategies

From the list of qualifying strategies, the strategies numbered 1 through 5 are already established and strategies 6 through 8 are under consideration by the town. Strategies 9 through 13 are recommended as appropriate considerations that the town has not yet acted on or are not currently under consideration by the town. Finally, the strategies numbered 14 and 15 should be reviewed over time to determine whether these actions are appropriate tools for the town.

**Final List of Qualifying Strategies (to be Eligible for Incentives Grants):**

a. The use of vacant publicly owned real property within the local government for development of affordable housing;
b. Granting duplexes, triplexes, or other appropriate multi-family housing options as a use-by-right in single-family residential zoning districts;
c. Authorizing accessory dwelling units as a use by-right on parcels in single-family zoning districts that meet the safety and infrastructure capacity considerations of local governments;
d. Allowing planned unit developments with integrated affordable housing units;
e. Allowing the development of small square footage residential unit sizes;
f. Other novel, innovative, or creative approaches to incentivize affordable housing development.
g. The creation of a program to subsidize or otherwise reduce local development review or fees, including but not limited to building permit fees, planning waivers, and water and sewer tap fees, for affordable housing development;
h. The creation of an expedited development review process for affordable housing aimed at households the annual income of which is at or below one hundred twenty percent of the area median income of households of that size in the county in which the housing is located;
i. The establishment of a density bonus program to increase the construction of units that meet critical housing needs in the local community;
j. The creation of an expedited development review process for acquiring or repurposing underutilized commercial property that can be rezoned to include affordable housing units, including the preservation of existing affordable housing units;
k. The classification of a proposed affordable housing development as a use by right when it meets the building density and design standards of a given zoning district;
l. Lessened minimum parking requirements for new affordable housing developments;
m. The creation of a land donation, land acquisition, or land banking program;
n. An inclusionary zoning ordinance (per CRS 29-20-104(1));
o. With respect to water utility charges, the creation of processes to promote the use of sub-metering of utility charges for affordable housing projects and the creation of expertise in water utility matters dedicated to affordable housing projects;
p. With respect to infrastructure, the creation of a dedicated funding source to subsidize infrastructure costs and associated fees related to publicly owned water, sanitary sewer, storm sewers, and roadways infrastructure.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 2

### Strategy 7: Potential Redevelopment of Existing Vacant Parcels

The Town of Nederland has existing vacant/underutilized land. A consideration for the Town of Nederland in partnership with the development community is identifying which of these vacant/underutilized parcels can be developed followed by the potential redevelopment of these parcels for new residential uses. Where any of these vacant parcels are publicly owned, an additional strategy could be the discounted sale of publicly owned property for affordable housing development, on parcels that do not have significant resource or recreational value. The cost of land can often be one of the highest costs associated with housing development. Discounting the sale of land under the control of public entities could have the potential to spur interest from the private sector and non-profit housing developers.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objectives 3 and 4

### Strategy 8: Tax Abatements or Exemptions

Property tax abatements for multi-family housing development or housing development that includes affordable housing units can be a tool that local governments offer to developers to incentivize new housing construction. Tax abatements reduce the amount of taxes owed for a specific time and reduce the property's assessed value or rate of taxation, which lowers the overall tax bill. For developers, this can be an enticing opportunity to have developments, especially housing developments that include subsidized units, pencil.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 4

### Strategy 9: Community Land Trusts

Community land trusts are a mechanism for spurring long-term affordable home-ownership opportunities in a community by having the community land trust retain ownership of the land on which housing units are developed and allowing the homebuyer to purchase only the home that is situated on the land. Community land trusts are a form of shared-equity homeownership. Under the traditional community land trust model, the land trust maintains ownership of the land and leases it out for affordable housing uses. This is typically done by selling the structure (whether a single-family home or a unit in a multifamily building) to an eligible buyer, along with a long-term ground lease (typically 99 years) that specifies the terms under which the home may be sold. Under this model, home buyers own the building (or attached unit) and lease the land from the land trust. Purchasers are often individual homeowners but can also be co-operatives or non-profit housing organizations or developers. As owners of the land, the land trust maintains a degree of control over initial and subsequent uses. These rights include an option to repurchase the buildings when the owner wishes to sell, control over the resale price, and limits on eligible future purchasers and the use of the building or unit. Owners typically pay a monthly ground lease fee which covers administrative costs and costs associated with property ownership, such as taxes, or repairs and maintenance. Homeowners build wealth in two ways: (1) through the forced savings gained by paying down the principal balance of their mortgage, and (2) through the share of home price appreciation allocated to them under the land trust's resale formula which is different per land trust. Community land trusts are typically administered by a non-profit organization or a quasi-governmental organization, such as a special district and usually have a governing body that consists of members of the public, home purchasers in the land trust, and governmental representatives.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 4

### Strategy 10: Rights of First Refusal

Rights of first refusal are contractual rights afforded to an interested party that allow the interested party the first right to purchase a property before going to the broader market or next interested party. The Town of Nederland can use rights of first refusal to preserve and create affordable housing in two different ways. First, rights of first refusal can help preserve existing affordable housing units by giving the Town of Nederland or a mission-driven non-profit organization with close ties to the Town of Nederland, the opportunity to purchase subsidized rental housing units when the owner of a subsidized housing unit(s) stops participating in the subsidy program. Second, the Town of Nederland could use the rights of first refusal to purchase existing non-subsidized rental housing units when the rental property goes up for sale. Rights of first refusal can be a helpful tool for local governments so that they have an option to purchase rental housing units before going on the broader market. Rights of first refusal can also be a helpful anti-displacement tool to keep renters in existing affordable housing units in their units.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 4

### Strategy 11: Rent Regulation

Rental regulation policies where local governments regulate the amount that landlords can increase rents year-over-year. This strategy allows renters to have a greater degree of predictability in their anticipated rental costs by not being subjected to dramatic rent increases.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 5

### Strategy 12: Just Cause Eviction Policy

Just cause eviction policies are a policy tool that local governments can use to limit the grounds upon which a landlord may evict a tenant. In most places, landlords are not required to provide a reason for a tenant's eviction, and these just cause policies can help tenants maintain a degree of residential stability by narrowing the scope of allowable grounds for eviction.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 5

### Strategy 13: Legal Assistance Programs

Legal assistance programs for at-risk renters are a less common strategy among local governments for tenant assistance, however, local governments around the county implement programs to expand access to legal services and legal counsel for low-income renters in their communities who are facing eviction or dealing with other serious housing issues such as fair housing discrimination or hazardous living conditions.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 5

### Strategy 14: HOME Tenant-Based Rental Assistance & Local Service Providers

The HOME Investment Partnership Program (HOME) provides formula-based block grants that localities and states can use to support different activities related to affordable housing, such as expanding the amount of tenant-based rental assistance that local jurisdictions and states can provide to low-income households. Cities, towns, and counties have authority to tailor tenant-based rental assistance through the HOME program to meet specific needs, including limiting program eligibility to specific groups (e.g., seniors, persons with a disability, etc.), and providing additional types of assistance to complement the tenant-based rental assistance, such as security deposits and help to cover utility costs. Additionally, the town could partner with Canyon Cares, a local non-profit service provider, to find financial assistance for low-income families needing short-term housing support. The town can play a proactive role in preventing displacement by connecting renter and homeowner households with local service providers such as Canyon Cares before households face lasting challenges such as eviction or foreclosure.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 5

### Strategy 15: Housing Choice Vouchers

The Town of Nederland could leverage their partnership with the Boulder County Housing Authority to manage the Housing Choice Voucher program that is administered by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and managed locally by public housing agencies. The Housing Choice Voucher program is the largest rental assistance program that HUD manages. The program allows participants to select rental housing that meets the program standards and then contributes a share of their income (usually around 30%) towards rent and utilities while the public housing agency (Boulder County Housing Authority in this case), using funds from the Housing Choice Voucher program, pays the remaining balance directly to the landlord.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 5

### Strategy 16: Up-Front Financial Assistance

It is not uncommon for low-income households to lack the necessary funds to cover a security deposit and required prepaid rent such as first/last month up-front. Public agencies can provide security deposit and first/last month rent expenses on behalf of low-income renters as a grant that is paid directly to landlords. The Town of Nederland could re-direct funds from impact fees associated with new development to build up a grant pool to administer for low-income or first-time renters to cover these up-front, prepaid expenses to reduce the barrier of access to rental housing units.

Cities, towns and counties have the option to develop programs to reduce the up-front costs of home purchases through forgivable loans, low/no interest loans, or grants that can cover costs such as down payments or closing costs. It is not uncommon for households to be able to afford the monthly mortgage of a home, but not have the accumulated savings to be able to purchase a home given the initial expenses associated with home purchases. Structured as grants, forgivable loans, no- or low-interest loans, or deferred loans, community down payment and closing cost assistance programs can help families who lack savings become successful homeowners.

Grants from local governments, or public housing authorities have the benefit of less administrative burden than publicly provided loans and do not require repayment, however, the pool of funding that generates the grants cannot always expect to be recaptured so they are typically a better application when the amount of up-front payment assistance is lower, typically $5,000 or less, so that the overall funding pool can be spread further. Structuring the assistance as a loan that must be repaid allows local governments to re-administer the funds; different families can be helped as loans are paid off. Recycling funds adds complexity and requires oversight, which can be a cumbersome requirement for local government staff. However, these publicly provided loans can significantly increase the scale of impact that limited resources provide, particularly in high-cost markets where down payment and closing cost assistance can amount to a substantial per-unit subsidy. Structuring down payment assistance as a loan works well in housing markets and locations where home values are steady or rising, as is the case in the Town of Nederland. A worthwhile consideration is that if home prices decline, it can be difficult for borrowers to repay these loans. Since it can be difficult to predict downturns in the housing market, cities, towns, and counties may wish to consider policies that forgive these loans in the event of such a downturn.

Cities and counties can use some federal funds, including HUD's HOME Investment Partnership and Community Development Block Grant program funds, to fund down payment and closing cost assistance programs. Cities and counties can also use locally generated funds exclusively or to supplement federal funding.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 5

### Strategy 17: Employer-Assisted Housing

Employer-assisted housing programs can be an effective way to leverage the resources of larger employers in a region that can help employees afford housing near their work through a variety of ways including downpayment assistance on for-sale housing units, rental subsidies, or the direct investment in or construction of new housing units. This is often a successful endeavor when one employer is contributing to a higher percentage of local employment. For the Town of Nederland, this could include a partnership with Eldora Ski Resort to provide housing for folks who are employed by Eldora Ski Resort and live, or want to live, in The Town of Nederland.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 5

### Strategy 18: Amending Building Codes

Building construction codes are an important safeguard to ensure that housing units are safe for human habitation. Building codes are typically used to regulate residential and non-residential building construction and can address things like plumbing, mechanical, electrical, and energy in a construction project. It is typical that local governments adopt model codes developed by national or international standards organizations like the International Code Council. These codes are then enforced through plan review when new development and redevelopment projects are initiated. These model codes can often be a helpful tool and baseline for local governments to feel confident that they are administering reasonable, and appropriate codes that influence the safety and habitability of buildings in their communities. These codes can also have requirements in construction standards and building regulations that raise costs associated with the project development but do little to make a building safer. For example, older codes may eliminate the use of new high-performance low-cost construction materials such as structured-insulated-panels that can reduce time and money on a building development project but may not be used due to a building code that restricts these materials. A first step for most local governments in reducing barriers to housing construction while ensuring high-quality housing is being built safely is to ensure that they are using the latest version of a model code from the International Code Council, then going through a self-audit to ensure that there are not any unnecessarily cumbersome requirements that are doing little to protect safety and blocking new developments.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 4

### Strategy 19: Square Footage Cap

The Town of Nederland could consider codifying a square footage cap on the habitable space associated with new single-unit residential buildings, not including garages or basements. This strategy would have the benefit of reducing the impact that large homes have on the home values in the surrounding market. Large homes have the effect of driving up median home value in the surrounding area which drives up home values of even more modestly sized homes and can lead to decreased affordability in a housing market even if smaller homes, and multi-unit homes are present. This would also incentivize smaller single unit construction which could help the town increase the number of missing middle housing units. Associated benefits also include smaller demands on the local utility network and increasing energy efficiency amongst new single unit residential buildings. Routt County, Colorado, a rural county in the mountains is currently considering a square footage cap of 7,500 square feet in order to reduce the impact of large homes on affordability in the region.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 4

### Strategy 20: Regulating Short-Term Rentals

Local governments, especially in mountain resort areas, are increasingly regulating short-term rentals. Short-term rentals are furnished rooms, homes, apartments, or other existing housing that is rented out on a short-term basis, typically less than one year. Short term rentals are typically rented out by a small-scale guest hosting operation, or the owner of the home. The fluid nature of short-term rental markets—which involve multiple hosts independently deciding whether and when to host a rental and through dozens of online platforms have led many local governments to consider regulating these short-term rentals to mitigate the potential effect that short-term rentals have on constraining the supply of existing housing units that could be used for residents that are instead being used commercially to host short-term non-residents. In 2022, the voters in the Town of Nederland approved an increase in the lodging occupation tax, which applies to short-term rentals, to a total of $4 per day per number of defined bedrooms in the unit which took effect on January 1, 2023. Should the Town of Nederland decide to add additional regulations on short-term rentals, the town will likely want to consider a range of policy options. Among the key regulatory tools available are:

- Monitoring of short-term rentals: Localities may require short-term rentals to register or acquire permits, which may include measures to protect the safety of tenants and mitigate potential disturbances for neighbors.
- Caps on the number of short-term rentals: Localities may choose to restrict the total number of permitted units in certain neighborhoods, zoning districts, or the town.
- Limits on the frequency of rentals: Localities may limit the number of nights a property can be rented as a short-term rental.
- Managing the location of short-term rental units and the density/concentration of short-term rental units.
- Restrictions on tenants: Localities may consider limiting the number of tenants who can stay in a short-term rental.
- Prohibiting certain types of short-term rentals: Localities might ban dedicated or investor-owned short-term rentals.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 4
