# Existing Conditions & Key Issues

## Zoning and Land Use

Zoning and land use are fundamental concepts in urban planning, though they refer to different aspects of land management. **Zoning** is the legal framework that dictates what can be built on a parcel of land, including the types of buildings and their uses, whereas **land use** describes the actual, on-the-ground use of land at a given time. In most cases, land use aligns with the zoning designation, but discrepancies can occur. Historic communities, like Nederland, developed before zoning laws often have higher rates of non-conforming uses.

To avoid confusion in this document, the names of zoning districts are capitalized, such as "General Commercial" or "Medium-Density Residential," while land uses are referred to in lowercase, such as "commercial" or "medium-density residential."

## Current Zoning

Nederland's zoning regulations encompass nine standard zoning districts, which are categorized into residential, commercial, industrial, and public zones. These districts are shown in Table 2. Understanding how land is zoned versus how it is currently used provides a crucial snapshot of the town's regulatory landscape and highlights areas where adjustments may be necessary.

**Table 2: Nederland's Nine Standard Zoning Districts**

| Zoning Code | Zone Name | Acres | Percent of Total Land Area |
|-------------|-----------|-------|---------------------------|
| CBD | Central Business District | 8 | 1% |
| GC | General Commercial | 33 | 4% |
| NC | Neighborhood Commercial | 12 | 1% |
| HDR | High Density Residential | 27 | 3% |
| MDR | Medium Density Residential | 37 | 5% |
| LDR | Low Density Residential | 81 | 10% |
| MR | Mountain Residential | 389 | 47% |
| I | Industrial | 19 | 2% |
| P | Public | 222 | 27% |

## Current Land Use

The existing land use in Nederland is categorized into eleven standard types, as shown in Table 3. This analysis reveals that nearly 27.4% of the land in Nederland is undeveloped, while low-density residential use occupies nearly half of the town's area. Parks and public land comprise 14.6% of land areas while other land uses, such as commercial, industrial, and public/civic, make up smaller percentages.

**Table 3: Land Use Categories in Nederland**

| Land Use Category | Use Description | Acres | Percent of Total Land Area |
|-------------------|-----------------|-------|---------------------------|
| Private Undeveloped | Undeveloped land in private ownership | 194.8 | 22.2% |
| Public Undeveloped | Undeveloped land in public ownership | 45.2 | 5.2% |
| Accommodation | Overnight accommodation, such as hotel | 2.5 | 0.3% |
| Commercial | Commercial uses such as restaurant, retail, service, office | 24.5 | 2.8% |
| High-density residential | Residential developments with 9+ units | 1.6 | 0.2% |
| Medium-density residential | Residential developments with 2-8 units | 3.8 | 0.4% |
| Low-density residential | Single-family detached houses | 419.6 | 47.9% |
| Industrial | Light industrial uses such as warehouses, light manufacturing, and auto mechanics | 19.6 | 2.2% |
| Public/Civic | Public and civic uses such as the Community Center, parks, and utilities | 34.3 | 4.0% |
| Religious | Buildings for religious congregations | 2.1 | 0.2% |
| Park/Public Land | Town parklands and other public lands that are primarily used for conservation, recreation, or some combination thereof | 128.3 | 14.6% |

## Key Issues & Concepts

### Undeveloped Land and the Relationship to Infill Development

27.4% of Nederland's land area is classified as undeveloped (public or private), highlighting some potential for infill development. However, not all vacant parcels are buildable due to environmental factors or regulatory barriers like minimum lot sizes.

Most of the undeveloped parcels are located in the Public, Mountain Residential, or High-Density Residential zones. Some of these parcels represent an opportunity for new development to occur without expanding into surrounding areas, especially if zoning regulations like minimum lot sizes are reduced to make them buildable. Whenever possible, infill development is preferable because it is fiscally and environmentally sustainable, increasing the value and economic output of existing land without requiring significant new infrastructure investment.

### Residential Zoning Densities

Nederland's four residential zones collectively account for 65% of the town's land area. These zones establish residential neighborhoods and give the town four residential character designations with varying levels of intensity. For example, the Mountain Residential zone regulates neighborhoods with the largest lot sizes and lowest density while the High-Density Residential zone regulates neighborhoods with the smallest lot sizes and highest potential for density.

Despite having distinct High Density and Medium Density Residential zoning districts, actual high-density and medium-density residential buildings (those with 9+ or 2-8 units, respectively) make up only 0.6% of all land area in Nederland. While in the past single-family housing development was promoted and prioritized, the recent Housing Needs Assessment has highlighted the need to make room for multi-family development as well. The current lack of medium and high-density residential housing is a missed opportunity to increase the town's total housing supply, especially since multi-unit housing is generally more affordable and can house workers.

Existing regulations in these zones make it challenging to permit multi-unit housing. For example, any building with more than 4 units must go through a special review or planned unit development (PUD) process. Furthermore, minimum lot sizes and minimum parking requirements render many of the parcels where multi-unit housing is theoretically allowed unbuildable in practice.

### Land Use & Industrial Opportunities at Wolf Tongue

The Wolf Tongue industrial zone is currently underutilized as an industrial zone. It is largely occupied by legally non-conforming residential uses, with only one parcel being used for industrial activities. While these residential uses are not seen as inappropriate for the character of the area, there is an opportunity to leverage Wolf Tongue more for light industrial uses that could support the local economy, such as a maker's space or auto mechanic shop. The ongoing discussion about the future of this area, currently identified as "Downtown Flex" in the Future Land Use Map (FLUM), presents an opportunity to rethink how this site contributes to a diversified and resilient local economy.

### The Need for More Affordable Housing

Nederland faces a significant need for more affordable housing. The 2023 Housing Needs Assessment (HNA) highlights that the town's housing costs have risen sharply, with a median home price of $800,000 and a significant portion of renters being cost-burdened. The need for affordable housing and the town's strategy to address these problems are addressed heavily in the following housing chapter. As a desired land use outcome, it is essential for land use regulations to support more affordable housing developments by adopting affordable housing-friendly permitting procedures. The town should also revisit any zoning regulations that add unnecessary friction to affordable housing development such as minimum lot size and minimum parking requirements.

### The Desire for Urban Growth Management and Sustainable Development

There is a community desire to manage growth in a way that prioritizes sustainability and limits expansion into natural habitat. Affordable housing and social services stakeholders identified benefits to encouraging denser development downtown, such as the ability to support more services, live within walking distance of key services, and provide better transportation options to residents.

Until December 2022, Nederland was involved in an intergovernmental agreement (IGA) with Boulder County that limited its ability to annex additional territory without the approval of the county. This agreement aimed to preserve Nederland's distinct character, prevent unplanned urban expansion, and maintain the rural nature of the surrounding lands. Despite its expiration, there hasn't been much progress on negotiating a new IGA since 2022. While the town now has more flexibility to grow, it also needs to be careful not to expand beyond its service limits or fiscal capacity. Infill development within the existing town boundaries offers a more sustainable alternative to outward expansion, allowing Nederland to accommodate growth while preserving surrounding natural landscapes and limiting the expansion of infrastructure and services.

### Yard and Bulk Standards

Some yard and bulk requirements in Nederland may be working against housing affordability and sustainability goals. The minimum lot sizes in the code are relatively large. The current large minimum lot sizes in the lowest-density residential districts may have adverse impacts on the realization of the community's goals. Namely, large lot sizes increase the cost of development due to the high costs of larger parcels of land, thereby decreasing affordability. Neighborhoods with the largest minimum lot sizes (Mountain Residential and Low-Density Residential zones, for example) correlate with Nederland's most expensive and largest single-family homes. Low-density, large lot development tends to produce a less efficient land use pattern in which the cost of providing public infrastructure often exceeds the municipal revenue (in the form of property taxes) generated by these large lot homes. The large lot sizes also render some lots in town unbuildable, reducing opportunities for infill or affordable housing. This pattern of land use further promotes growth into surrounding undeveloped lands, degrading community values of sustainability and conservation for ecological and scenic purposes.

As an example of the issues caused by large lot size minimums, in the Mountain Residential (MR) zone, the minimum lot size is 1 acre. However, there are several existing developments in that zone on lots smaller than an acre. Arguably, these legally non-conforming uses pose no real misalignment with the zone's intent, indicating that the regulation may be overly restrictive. The same is true in the Low-Density Residential zone where the minimum lot size is 16,000 square feet. Below are two examples of legally non-conforming developments that would not be permitted without a variance under today's minimum lot size requirements:

- **99 King Pl.** was built in 1981 on a 12,200 square foot lot and could not be permitted in the Low-density Residential zone today without variance.
- **33 Ponderosa Dr.** was built in 1967 on a 0.51-acre lot and could not be permitted in the Mountain Residential zone today without variance.

### Preserving Mountain Town Character

As part of the Downtown Subarea planning process, Open House attendees and respondents to the online survey were asked a series of questions about architecture, the character of Nederland, and what makes Nederland have a 'unique sense of place.' Overwhelmingly, results pointed towards the value of preserving mountain town character. Words like "rustic", "local", "community", "walkable", "historic", "vibrant", "funky", "natural setting", and "creek access" were used to describe what people love about Downtown.

At the Open House, attendees were also asked to vote for architectural development styles they would like to see downtown. The most popular architectural attributes included hardened materials, balconies, no more than two stories, smaller buildings, rustic aesthetic, local art, creek access, and references to mining history.

### Current Development Process

Nederland's current development process channels a disproportionately high number of projects through a Planned Unit Development (PUD) process, which is administratively costly and time-consuming for both the town and developers. The PUD process is appropriate for projects that require multiple variances or that are non-conforming to the underlying zoning code. However, the current scope of the PUD regulations is too broad, even requiring standard developments to undergo this complex process. Revising these regulations to streamline permitting for conforming developments could encourage growth while maintaining appropriate oversight for more complex projects.

## Conclusion

These existing conditions and key issues provide a foundation for the objectives and strategies that will guide Nederland's future land use decisions. By understanding the current landscape of land use and contemporary planning challenges, the town can guide decisions that balance growth, sustainability, and the preservation of its unique character. The following section will outline specific objectives and strategies designed to address these key issues and help Nederland achieve its long-term vision.
