# Land Use

This chapter lays the foundation for the vision, goals, and policies that will direct Nederland's future growth, development, and community character. The concepts in this chapter were developed through conversations with stakeholders about the needs of the community, an analysis of existing land uses, regulations, and market conditions, and public input on the priorities of the town and the desired character of the community. This chapter includes policy recommendations to improve land use outcomes, the 3-mile plan, and the Future Land Use Map (FLUM). These policies and plans are intended to move Nederland towards sustainable growth and development, promote the development of more affordable housing, and protect the rustic and eclectic mountain town character of Nederland.

## Land Use Vision Statement

> Nederland's land use regulations help achieve sustainable development goals, affordable and sufficient housing, and maintain historic mountain town character. Land use regulations support business and residential needs. The zoning code is consistent, easy to interpret, and supports the next increment of growth and development needed to strengthen the local economy and house new workers and families.
