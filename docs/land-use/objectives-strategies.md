# Objectives & Strategies

## Objective 1: Direct New Growth to Appropriate Locations and Encourage Sustainable Infill Development

As Nederland continues to grow at a modest rate, it is essential to manage this growth by directing development to appropriate locations and ensuring it occurs at a scale that balances growth and sustainability. In other words, new development should not outpace the Town's ability to provide services or recuperate costs for new infrastructure maintenance. New development can be positive, offering opportunities for Nederland to attract businesses, accommodate new residents, increase the tax base, and fund vital infrastructure and services. However, unmanaged growth can lead to uncontrolled expansion into sensitive landscapes or introduce developments that disrupt the character of existing neighborhoods, posing environmental and fiscal risks.

To mitigate these potential harms, Nederland should focus on directing greenfield development to specific, suitable areas identified in the 3-Mile Plan and implement an urban growth management strategy to discourage expansion outside these areas. Regarding infill development and adaptive reuse, the town will support property owners in incrementally expanding and redeveloping their properties. This approach to growth increases the value and utility of existing land, enhances community prosperity, and avoids the need for extensive new infrastructure investment, making it both fiscally and environmentally sustainable. Infill development will be guided by land use regulations that ensure new projects fit within the character of existing neighborhoods, preserving the town's unique identity and natural scenery while allowing for gradual, sustainable growth.

## Objective 2: Promote the Development of More Affordable Housing with Supportive Land Use Regulation

To address housing affordability and meet the Housing Needs Assessment (HNA) recommendations, Nederland will evaluate and consider revising land use regulations to eliminate barriers to housing development. This could include reducing restrictive yard and bulk requirements, easing minimum parking requirements, and streamlining the permitting process for multi-family and affordable housing projects. Making these changes could help the town facilitate the construction of smaller homes, diverse housing types, and affordable housing complexes, ultimately ensuring that housing needs are met in a timely and cost-effective manner.

## Objective 3: Preserve the Historic Mountain Town Character of Downtown Nederland

Nederland values the historic quality of its downtown and the eclectic, rustic mountain town feel of the entire community. To preserve these qualities, the town may consider evaluating development proposals against architectural design requirements and form-based zoning standards, particularly within the downtown subarea. Future development proposals will be evaluated for consistency with established character areas from the Downtown Subarea Plan, with a focus on preserving views, limiting building heights to 35 feet, and encouraging the adaptive reuse of historic buildings. Community input will be sought to ensure that preservation efforts reflect the values and aspirations of residents. More information about this recommendation can be found within the Downtown Subarea Plan.

## Objective 4: Support Key Business Uses in Appropriate Locations for a Strong and Flexible Local Economy

To foster a strong and adaptable local economy, Nederland will promote the development of high-quality, flexible commercial spaces that meet the needs of key business sectors such as childcare, healthcare, and other essential services. The town will work to reduce regulatory barriers for these businesses, particularly in underutilized areas like the industrial Wolf Tongue Area, which will be promoted for flexible commercial use. By supporting diverse business opportunities, Nederland aims to enhance economic resilience and provide essential services to the community.

## Objective 5: Clarify and Simplify Code and Land Use Designations

Nederland is committed to making its land use regulations clear, accessible, and easy to interpret for all residents. Simplified and transparent permitting processes will empower property owners to engage in local development, contributing to the town's prosperity and strong community foundation. The town will reserve the Planned Unit Development (PUD) process for complex projects requiring multiple variances while ensuring that the comprehensive plan provides a streamlined, objective framework for evaluating development proposals.

## Objective 6: Mitigate Hazard Exposure and Risk Through Land Use Regulation

Nederland will use land use regulations to minimize exposure to environmental hazards and protect both property owners and the broader community. The town will continue to prohibit development within the FEMA-designated 100-year floodplain and will discourage development in areas with elevated wildfire exposure which may be determined by referencing the Colorado State Forest Service Wildfire Risk Map. Proactive planning measures, such as encouraging defensible space and home hardening through education and regulation, will be employed to mitigate wildfire risk. By integrating hazard mitigation into land use planning, Nederland can enhance community resilience and safeguard its natural and built environments.

## Strategies

### Strategy 1: Evaluate and Adjust Minimum Lot Size Requirements

Explore the potential for reducing minimum lot size requirements across all residential zones to promote the development of smaller housing units that enhance Nederland's housing diversity while maintaining the character of existing neighborhoods. Consider halving the minimum lot sizes in the Mountain Residential and Low-Density Residential zones to unlock new development opportunities. In the Mountain Residential zone, the current minimum lot size is 1 acre which could be reduced to 0.5 acres, meanwhile, the minimum lot size in the Low Density Residential zone is 16,000 sq ft, which could be reduced to 8,000 sq ft. This adjustment could make previously undeveloped, undersized lots viable for development and allow for the subdivision of larger lots into multiple parcels that can be developed, thereby increasing the town's overall housing stock.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objectives 1 and 2

### Strategy 2: Revise Off-Street Parking Requirements

Explore reducing off-street parking minimums for multi-unit residential developments in the Commercial, High-Density Residential, and Medium-Density Residential zones to facilitate easier multi-unit development. Consider updating the current requirement of one off-street parking spot per bedroom with a more flexible standard, as outlined in the proposed table below. This new approach would still mandate a baseline of off-street parking for new developments while allowing any additional parking needs to be met through optional developer-provided spaces.

**Table 5: Potential Policy Update to Reduce Off-Street Parking Minimums**

| Unit Type | 1 or 2 Bedrooms | 3 Bedrooms | 4 or More Bedrooms |
|-----------|-----------------|------------|---------------------|
| Minimum number of off-street parking spaces for an attached Dwelling Unit | 1 | 1.5 | 2 |

**Relevant Objectives:** Objectives 1 and 2

### Strategy 3: Simplify Permitting for Multi-Unit Residential Developments

Amend the code to eliminate the requirement for residential developments with four or more units to undergo a Planned Unit Development (PUD) process. Instead, establish a streamlined permitting pathway for multi-family development proposals, allowing them to follow a standard approval process, thereby reducing complexity and encouraging the development of additional housing units.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objectives 2 and 5

### Strategy 4: Implement Strategy 2: "Accessory Dwelling Units" from the Housing Chapter

Amend the code to permit more than one accessory dwelling unit (ADU) per property, provided that the property continues to meet all applicable yard and bulk standards. For more information, reference the corresponding strategy in the Housing chapter.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 2

### Strategy 5: Designate Affordable Housing as a By-Right Use

Update the zoning code's use table to classify affordable housing as an allowed use by right in all residential zone districts, ensuring that affordable housing projects can proceed without the need for special approvals or conditional use permits. Strategy 1, in the Housing chapter provides recommendations for further defining affordable housing.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 2

### Strategy 6: Explore Inclusionary Zoning

Investigate the feasibility of implementing inclusionary zoning, a strategy that requires or encourages developers to dedicate a percentage (typically 10-20%) of units in new residential developments to affordable housing. Recognized as a recommended approach by DOLA under HB1271 for increasing affordable housing supply (see Strategy 6: "Implement additional qualifying 1271 Strategies" of the housing Chapter), this policy requires careful consideration. Prior to adoption, the town should conduct a thorough impact and feasibility analysis to assess potential effects, including the risk of discouraging development due to increased project costs. Key considerations for implementation include evaluating available incentives and grant opportunities for developers, studying best practices from other municipalities, and analyzing the strength of the local real estate and development market.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 2

### Strategy 7: Explore Strategy 3: "Density Bonus" from the Housing Chapter

Consider implementing a density bonus program that would allow developers to build additional units or gain an extra floor beyond the existing height limits in exchange for providing a specified number of affordable housing units. For more information, reference the corresponding strategy in the housing chapter.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 2

### Strategy 8: Develop a Booklet of Pre-Approved Residential Designs

Create a booklet of pre-approved architectural designs and styles for missing middle housing typologies, including duplexes, townhomes, and small apartment buildings, to streamline the development review process and ensure new housing fits seamlessly into existing neighborhoods.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objectives 2 and 3

### Strategy 9: Implement the First Street Overlay Zone

Enact the First Street Overlay as recommended in the Downtown Subarea Plan to enhance architectural control over future developments along First Street. This overlay will introduce specific form and bulk standards to ensure that new proposals align with the desired character of the area.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 3

### Strategy 10: Encourage the Protection of Historic Assets

As described in depth in the Downtown Subarea Plan, promote the preservation of historic assets within the town by actively encouraging property owners to explore preservation opportunities, utilize available tax credit incentives, and consider establishing historic districts for significant areas downtown.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 3

### Strategy 11: Promote Adaptive Reuse and Activation of Vacant Buildings and Sites

Encourage the revitalization of vacant and underutilized properties by making adaptive reuse more feasible for property owners and developers. Strategies may include expedited permitting, façade improvement grants, use variances, and land banking. Additionally, consider implementing a vacant property registration, tax penalties for long-term vacancies, and a blighted property ordinance to incentivize timely redevelopment. These efforts aim to activate downtown spaces and align redevelopment with the town's vision.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objectives 3 and 4

### Strategy 12: Designate In-Home Childcare as a By-Right Use

Amend the use table to allow in-home childcare as a by-right use in all residential zones, eliminating the need for a special review permit. This change responds to the community's clear need for local childcare services and supports residents in opening in-home childcare centers more easily. By simplifying the regulatory process, the town can better address childcare demands while ensuring that safety and qualification standards are met through other appropriate regulations.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 4

### Strategy 13: Promote the Renovation of Commercial Buildings for Enhanced Business Use

Encourage the renovation of aging commercial buildings to create higher-quality spaces suitable for advanced commercial activities, such as healthcare offices and other professional services. This initiative aims to elevate the standard of commercial properties in the town, attracting higher-order businesses and contributing to the economic vitality of the community.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 4

### Strategy 14: Evaluate and Redefine the Industrial Zone

Conduct a comprehensive review of the existing industrial zone, where a significant portion is currently used for residential purposes. The town should explore two potential pathways: rezone the area to allow for a mix of residential, commercial, and industrial uses, or revise the definition and permitted uses within the industrial zoning category to better align with the current and future needs of the site. This process will require detailed analysis and input from the Planning Commission to ensure that the revised zoning reflects the community's vision and accommodates appropriate uses, such as maker spaces or other commercial-industrial activities, that can coexist with residential development.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objectives 4 and 5

### Strategy 15: Revise PUD Requirements and Streamline Permitting Pathways

Conduct a comprehensive review and revision of the Planned Unit Development (PUD) regulations to ensure that only projects requiring multiple variances or those that are non-conforming to the underlying land use code are routed through the PUD process. Simplify and clarify permitting pathways for conforming developments to reduce administrative burdens on town staff and developers, allowing for more efficient and predictable project approvals. This approach will maintain appropriate oversight for complex developments while ensuring that routine projects can proceed without unnecessary delays or added costs.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objectives 5, 2, and 1

### Strategy 16: Ensure Development Consistency with the Comprehensive Plan

Implement a project consistency evaluation rubric as a tool to objectively assess whether development proposals align with the goals and objectives outlined in the comprehensive plan. This rubric or step-by-step process will provide clear guidance for evaluating proposals, ensuring that all developments contribute positively to the town's long-term vision and strategic priorities. Adding a statement of consistency to the Nederland Municipal Code will help codify consistency between the comprehensive plan and municipal code.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 5

### Strategy 17: Implement Strategy 4: "Expedited Development Review Process" from the Housing Chapter

Simplify development review processes for affordable housing projects. Please reference the corresponding strategy in the Housing chapter for more information.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objectives 5 and 2

### Strategy 18: Implement Strategy 5: "Decrease Development Review Fees, Impact Fees, and Associated Development Fees" from the Housing Chapter

Reduce the financial barriers associated with development review for affordable housing projects. Please reference the corresponding strategy in the Housing chapter for more information.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objectives 5 and 2

### Strategy 19: Evaluate Land Use Regulations for Alignment with Wildland Urban Interface Code Best Practices

Evaluate how existing land use regulations could be amended to better align with land use best practices in fire-prone areas. Consider updating building codes or development standards to require fire-resistant building materials and construction. Provide guidance on using fire-resistant materials and construction techniques, including non-combustible roof assemblies, eaves, vents, gutters, exterior walls, windows, and surface coverings to improve the resilience of homes and buildings. Consider requiring vegetation management as a site development standard including actions such as tree thinning, spacing, limbing, and trimming; removal of any vegetation growing under tree canopies (typically referred to as "ladder fuels"), surface vegetation removal, and brush clearance; vegetation conversion, fuel modifications, and landscaping.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 6

## 3-Mile Plan

The three-mile plan shows a three-mile radius surrounding the Town of Nederland. Per the Colorado Revised Statutes 31-12-105(e), municipalities are required to conduct long-range planning for growth and annexation within three miles of their boundary.

Nederland's three-mile future land use map shows public lands such as US Forest Service Lands and County Open Space. These land classifications restrict Nederland's ability to grow in these areas. The map also shows private lands that are eligible to be annexed. Areas that could be considered for annexation/future growth were identified by members of the planning commission and are outlined in black.

### Annexation Considerations

Annexation offers both opportunities and challenges for Nederland as it plans for future growth. As a positive, annexation can give the town greater control over land use in surrounding areas, allowing for more strategic and cohesive development that aligns with the town's vision and goals. It can also expand the tax base, bringing in additional revenue that can be used to support infrastructure, services, and amenities for residents. Moreover, annexing adjacent lands could create opportunities for expanding housing options, commercial spaces, and public facilities, helping to address some of the town's current challenges, such as housing affordability and economic diversification. Additionally, increasing the number of citizens within town boundaries could allow for greater participation on town boards and other official participation opportunities that folks living outside of town boundaries are currently excluded from.

However, annexation also comes with potential downsides. Expanding the town's boundaries can strain existing infrastructure and public services, requiring significant investments in utilities, roads, and emergency services to accommodate the new areas. There is also the risk of disrupting the natural landscapes and rural character that surrounds Nederland, which could be at odds with the community's desire to preserve its unique mountain town feel. Additionally, annexation may lead to increased development pressure and challenges in maintaining the balance between growth and environmental sustainability. These factors must be carefully weighed as the town considers potential annexations within the 3-mile radius, ensuring that any expansion aligns with long-term goals for sustainable and controlled growth.

## Future Land Use Map (FLUM)

The Future Land Use Map (FLUM) is a critical component of Nederland's comprehensive plan, serving as a visual guide for the town's long-term development strategy. The FLUM reflects the community's vision for growth, land use, and preservation, and it provides a framework for making informed decisions about where and how future development should occur. It is a tool that helps translate the goals, objectives, and strategies outlined in this plan into actionable spatial policies, ensuring that growth is directed to appropriate locations while protecting the town's character and natural environment.

The FLUM identifies areas for residential, commercial, industrial, and public uses, as well as areas for mixed-use development and open space. The FLUM itself is not a zoning map and does not hold regulatory power. However, by delineating these areas, the FLUM helps to guide zoning decisions, inform infrastructure planning, and ensure that future development is compatible with the town's overall vision.

Town officials, planners, developers, and community members will use the FLUM as a reference point when evaluating development proposals, rezoning requests, and other land use decisions. It provides a clear visual representation of where different types of development are encouraged, where conservation is prioritized, and how various land uses should relate to one another. By aligning future growth with the patterns established in the FLUM, Nederland can ensure that its development is strategic, sustainable, and in harmony with the community's values.

The following future land use categories are used in the FLUM and defined below:

- **Downtown Core Mixed Use** – this area follows the currently zoned CBD area. A mix of uses is desired in this area, and it should continue to function as the walkable downtown core. Commercial uses on the ground floors of buildings with residential, offices, or lodging above are appropriate.

- **General Commercial** – these areas are appropriate for larger-format commercial buildings (as exists today) though mixed use is allowed and should be encouraged as well.

- **Neighborhood Mixed Use** – this area follows the currently zoned NC area. These properties should remain residential in character, but a mix of light commercial and residential use is appropriate.

- **Downtown Residential** – these areas are appropriate for, and mainly function today as, multifamily residential, minus the church property. Residential continues to be supported in these areas as an appropriate use.

- **Flex** – this area includes the Wolf Tongue Mill area. This is the only industrial-zoned land in Nederland today. While industry was the former use of the area, it is not anticipated that industrial uses will grow or are appropriate in downtown. Allowing this area to be more flexible in use, including residential, commercial, and light industrial is more appropriate.

- **Neighborhood Residential** – these areas are the core residential zones in Nederland and are appropriate for a variety of housing typologies including single-family homes, duplexes, townhomes, cottage courts, and small apartment buildings. Non-residential uses like churches, schools, daycare, and public spaces are also appropriate.

- **Mountain Residential** – these areas are peripheral residential zones in Nederland with single-family homes built on larger lots. These zones typically have difficult topography and are tucked further into mountainous terrain, making them more or less appropriate for more intense residential development.

- **Parks & Open Space** – these areas should be maintained as land for the public to enjoy. As stated previously, this includes the potential to acquire the triangular lot (Amerigas Lot) for public use.

- **Public** – these areas are public uses today (Town Hall, parking lots, Mining Museum, Library, town facilities, etc.) and should be maintained as such uses in the future.
