# Plan Framework: Resilience

## Defining Resilience

Community resilience describes the capacity of places to function so that the people living and working in them can survive and thrive no matter what stresses or shocks they encounter. Coming from the field of ecology in the 1970s, resilience refers to the ability of complex systems to maintain equilibrium or recover quickly from shocks and other unforeseen circumstances. The concept of 'resilience' can also apply to a community such as Nederland because the town is a complex system that must adapt to changing circumstances and unexpected stressors. This adaptation must be done while maintaining social cohesion and community identity, sound decision-making and governance, physical infrastructure, a robust economy, and a healthy environment.

"Resilience" serves as a high-level core value for this plan. It is the driver behind the more specific goals, policies, and actions in this plan, and a guidepost to orient key community decisions about growth, development, investment, and prioritization.

## Why Resilience?

Resilience is a highly relevant framework to guide decision-making in Nederland because it aligns with existing community values and can help address pressing concerns the town faces now and in the near future. It is a framework that meets the demands of the current moment. Over the next decade, exposure to natural hazards and uncertainty due to climate change will undoubtedly increase. When community members were asked what sustainability initiatives were a top priority for them, they identified mitigating wildfire risk and protecting water supply as two of the top concerns. These results highlight the widespread community concern for increasing hazard risk and environmental unpredictability.

In conversations with community members, leaders, and stakeholders, the values of sustainability, living in harmony with nature, and being self-reliant and hardy were raised in almost every conversation. The reality of living in an alpine environment means community members in Nederland recognize the challenges of the climate and environment they are a part of, and because of that have a strong awareness and respect for the area's natural environment.

In the context of climate change, the concept of resilience helps bridge the gap between sustainability policies such as carbon emission reduction and land conservation, and hazard risk reduction initiatives like wildfire preparedness and mitigation. Both concepts, sustainability and hazard preparedness, are central to Nederland's trajectory and fit under the umbrella of 'resilience.' Going beyond environmental topics, resilience encompasses other key planning topics in this plan such as transportation, city services, infrastructure, quality governance, local economy, health and social services, community culture, and housing development. Each of these topics contributes to a strong community that is socially and physically flexible, resourceful, inclusive, and integrated. This makes resilience a powerful way to frame the future of Nederland both for this plan and for future key decisions as they arise.

## Driving Policy with the City Resilience Index

The City Resilience Index is a theoretical framework that helps apply the concept of resilience to urban growth and development. It was developed by sustainable development experts at the consulting firm, ARUP, and funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. At the highest level, the CRI breaks the concept of resilience into 4 dimensions. For this comprehensive plan, these 4 dimensions offer a practical way of framing the proposed goals, actions, and policies herein. In this plan, each proposed policy is categorized by one or more of these dimensions of resilience, which helps show how each contributes to Nederland's resilient future.

The four dimensions of resilience are listed and described below.

## The Relationship Between Sustainability and Resilience

The last comprehensive plan in Nederland was organized around the core value of sustainability. As it pertains to urban development, sustainability is often defined as, "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs." Sustainability refers to the responsible consumption of resources and mitigating environmental harm through policies like reducing emissions, protecting lands, or recycling waste.

Sustainability is a necessary component of resilience. An unsustainable city cannot be resilient, because it will eventually deplete itself of its necessary resources and contribute to the conditions that exacerbate climate change or any other number of self-harming dynamics. In this sense, sustainability is a value that falls under the broader concept of resilience.

Sustainability is an important component of this plan and is one of the highest values expressed by Nederland community members. Nederland will continue to uphold sustainability as a core value and should consider it as an inherent part of the resilience framework. The shift from sustainability to resilience reflects an evolution in environmental thinking, focusing not only on responsibly consuming and protecting resources but also on considering a community's adaptability and ability to live in harmony with nature. While the definition of resilience is different from sustainability, resilience implies and requires sustainability.

## Four Dimensions of Resilience

### Health & Wellbeing

This dimension of resilience relates to people. It encompasses the health and well-being of everyone living and working in Nederland and considers the extent to which the town supports people's ability to meet their basic needs, including social welfare, safe and affordable housing, and healthcare.

### Economy & Society

This dimension of resilience relates to organization and identity. It encompasses the social and economic systems that enable Nederland's residents to live peacefully and act collectively. It includes social identity, systems of safety and law, and having a sustainable local economy.

### Infrastructure & Ecosystems

This dimension of resilience relates to place. It encompasses the natural and built environment in Nederland and includes topics like transportation, the effective provision of critical services, mitigating natural hazard exposure, and stewarding the natural environment.

### Leadership & Strategy

This dimension of resilience relates to knowledge and collaboration. It encompasses Nederland's ability to learn from the past and take effective action based on evidence. It includes having effective leadership and collaboration and involving community members and stakeholders in planning and decision-making.
