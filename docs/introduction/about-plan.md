# About This Plan

## The Role of a Comprehensive Plan

A comprehensive plan is a document that guides land use policy, future growth, development, and preservation for a community over several years. The community planning process involves a combination of public engagement and analysis and is designed to draw out public priorities such as land use, housing, transportation, economic development, natural resources, and public services. By integrating input from residents, stakeholders, and local leaders, a comprehensive plan provides a cohesive framework that guides decision-making and policy development, ensuring that the town evolves in a way that reflects the shared values and aspirations of its community. The plan document represents the final phase of the planning process, after which the municipality may implement the recommendations of the plan and use the plan as a policy guide for the years to come. It is important to recognize the comprehensive plan's role as an aspirational and community-driven visioning document. Staff, commissions, and elected officials are encouraged to utilize the comprehensive plan to align working efforts and investments with community-engagement driven priorities. However, the Comprehensive Plan is not code or legally binding. It is better thought of as a guide and a source of strategies that boards, commissions, and departments may consider to achieve certain goals.

## Planning Process

To update the comprehensive plan, the planning team conducted a robust existing conditions assessment that included a review of existing policies, land use and zoning, transportation and connectivity, economic development, housing, natural resources, hazard exposure, and infrastructure. The planning team also conducted focus groups with key stakeholders for each plan chapter as well as a robust community engagement process designed to understand the community's vision and top priorities for the town.

The planning process incorporated a parallel in-depth design and land use analysis of downtown Nederland, culminating in the Downtown Subarea Plan. The Downtown Subarea Plan is a standalone vision and policy document, but part of this comprehensive plan process. It is referenced several times in this document and goes into more depth on issues specific to Downtown.

## Legal Foundation

A comprehensive plan is described in the Colorado State Statutes Section 31-23-206 as an "advisory document to guide land development decisions." The statute provides that "it is the duty of the [planning] commission to make and adopt a master plan for the physical development of the municipality, including any areas outside its boundaries, subject to the approval of the governmental body having jurisdiction thereof [Board of Trustees]." Following the adoption of the community plan or comprehensive plan, it is the task of the Board of Trustees to update zoning and other local policies to align with the adopted community plan.

## Community Engagement

The engagement process for the comprehensive plan update involved two primary opportunities for community input: a Visioning Open House and an online survey. The Open House, held on January 23rd at the Nederland Community Center, brought together approximately 40 attendees. Participants interacted with 12 themed poster boards covering key topics such as parks, recreation, sustainability, housing, and economic development, offering feedback through stickers, write-ins, and multiple-choice questions. This in-person event facilitated direct conversations between community members, town staff, and the planning team.

To complement the Open House, an online survey was launched the same day and remained open until March 5th, gathering 205 responses. The survey mirrored the Open House questions, allowing residents who couldn't attend or preferred a slower-paced environment to share their thoughts. Together, these engagement efforts provide valuable insights into the community's vision and priorities for the next decade. Insights from the open house and survey helped this plan prioritize policies and formulate vision statements to drive each topic area.

## Plan Vision

Each chapter starts with a topic area vision statement that articulates the goals of the Town for that topic and is the core driver behind the policies within. This vision statement is the over-arching town vision that weaves the topic area vision statements from each chapter together into one comprehensive statement about the future and direction of Nederland.

> Nederland is a small, friendly mountain town, defined by its hardy locals and a vibrant sense of community. Visitors experience a welcoming and authentic atmosphere where history blends seamlessly with the energy of a well-maintained and economically diverse modern town. As a role model for small-town sustainability, Nederland's residents honor and steward their unique mountain ecosystem, while fostering the resilience needed to thrive in a dynamic environment. In Nederland, neighbors support neighbors, and the town offers jobs, housing, and inclusive leadership for all residents in the Peak-to-Peak region, ensuring a future where everyone can thrive.

## Plan Structure

The Nederland comprehensive plan is structured around nine main topic area chapters. Within each chapter is an "existing conditions and key issues" section, which is a point-in-time summary of related information and issues for each topic theme. These sections provide valuable baseline information about each topic and contribute to the policy direction. The policy section of each chapter is titled "Objectives and Strategies." These sections are broken into objectives (overarching goals and a general approach to achieving the goals) and strategies (more specific policy and programmatic recommendations that the town may consider). Strategies are not legally binding but are potential actions that may be implemented as boards, commissions, and town staff identify priorities, and develop work/investment plans that align with staff and fiscal capacity.

This comprehensive plan is also driven by the guiding framework of resilience. The City Resilience Index<sup>1</sup> is a way of applying the concept of resilience to urban planning and is utilized to align each objective of this plan with a sub-topic within resilience. For more information about the resilience framework please read the "Plan Framework: Resilience" section below. It is important to note that each objective in this comprehensive plan is tagged with one of the following four resilience themes throughout. Look for the following icons throughout the plan document to reference each of these resilience themes.
