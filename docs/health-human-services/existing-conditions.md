# Existing Conditions & Key Issues

The Town of Nederland and surrounding Boulder County, and Peak-to-Peak neighboring communities have a variety of community, health, and human resources available to area residents. Further, Nederland supports local community well-being by funding the Nederland Health and Human Services Fund through the Lodging Occupation Tax recently enacted in 2023. Several of the community resources and service providers are outlined in greater detail below. Generally, the Town of Nederland is well served by an extensive network of resource and social service providers and should continue to promote these services to residents, as well as leverage partnerships between service providers and the Town of Nederland where appropriate.

## Social Services

### Nederland Food Pantry, Community Gardens & Clothing Closet

The Nederland Food Pantry works to relieve hunger and provide basic needs that support the Peak-to-Peak Community by offering a food pantry and clothing closet to those in need. The Food Pantry also helps host a Human Services Fair each fourth Thursday of the month from 10 am to noon in the Community Center. At the fair, attendees can meet representatives from Boulder County Health and Human Services, sign up for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and other services, get personal finance advice, and meet with other key partners like EFAA, Canyon Cares, the Area Agency on Aging, and Mental Health Partners.

### Emergency Family Assistance Association

The Emergency Family Assistance Association (EFAA) provides stabilizing services, innovative programs, and transformative advocacy to strengthen families and create a thriving community where families can get out of poverty. They offer a food bank (in North Boulder), financial assistance, and operate 60 housing units across Boulder County, including a 10-unit property in Nederland purchased in January of 2023. EFAA also manages cases, helps connect clients to various peer organizations and resources, and provides education about financial resources and products. While based in Boulder, EFAA has a strong presence in the County's rural communities outside of the City of Boulder and provides equivalent services to residents in outlying areas of Boulder County.

### Canyon Cares

Canyon Cares is a non-profit organization providing short-term financial assistance to help care for the necessities and urgent needs of neighbors. Their service area includes the southern portion of the Peak-to-Peak region, including Nederland, Rollinsville, Ward, and Black Hawk. Assistance awards can go towards categories such as housing, utilities, transportation, medical costs, education, and food.

## Health Services

### Clinica Family Health

Clinica Family Health is an affordable healthcare provider that expands access to healthcare for those in need. They recently opened two new locations in June of 2022, servicing mountain communities in the Peak-to-Peak region from offices in Gilpin County and Nederland. Both clinics offer a full scope of primary care services. The Clinica locations offer pharmacies, with limitations on providing controlled substances and only serving those with Medicaid or on a self-pay plan. The mountain clinics do not provide dental services, but locations in Lafayette, Denver, and Thornton do provide those services for patients with Medicaid.

### Peak to Peak Counseling

Peak to Peak Counseling is a Nederland-based family-owned business providing counseling, therapy, and life coaching services. They offer both in-person and Telehealth psychotherapy sessions, serving the Peak-to-Peak region, Gilpin County, and Front Range communities. They do not accept insurance; however, they do offer a 'sliding scale rate' where sessions are conducted by their psychotherapy interns.

### Mental Health Partners

Mental Health Partners is a Boulder County-based non-profit organization providing comprehensive mental health care. Their Nederland Clinic is partnered with Clinica Family Health, and all together provides comprehensive behavioral, mental, and physical health care services from one convenient location in Nederland.

### Boulder Community Health PILLAR Program

The BCH PILLAR Program (formerly Opioid & Chronic Pain Response Program) provides free assistance to Boulder County residents with healthcare matters relating to chronic pain and/or opioid and other substance use disorders. The program provides short-term case management services and referrals to community agencies for those seeking treatment in an outpatient setting or through higher levels of care. The PILLAR Program is funded by the City of Boulder's Health Equity Fund and Substance Education & Awareness Fund and is housed in Boulder at the Center for Mind-Body Medicine.

## Transportation Options

### Boulder County Mobility for All

The goal of the Mobility for All (M4A) Program is to promote accessible, affordable, and equitable multimodal (transit, bike, etc.) transportation options for residents of all ages and abilities and to raise awareness on transportation challenges. The program is currently undergoing efforts to create a mountain volunteer driver program called "Peak Ride." Peak Ride would be aimed at empowering seniors, people with disabilities, and caregivers living in mountain communities in Boulder County. The Peak Ride planning process created a working group made up of community partners, older adults, people with disabilities, and caregivers to guide the planning process. The working group met monthly in Nederland, Allenspark, Jamestown, Ward, Lyons, and Gold Hill to develop the framework of a volunteer driver program, which is still under process.

### Colorado CarShare

As a mission-driven non-profit organization, Colorado CarShare is the country's first nonprofit Electric Vehicle (EV) carshare program. This includes providing subsidies to low-to-mixed-income (LMI) communities that are typically underserved when it comes to affordable mobility options. Nederland will be receiving an EV Colorado CarShare vehicle in the Summer of 2024 that will be available to residents from the RTD park and ride. Boulder County has waived the enrollment fee of $25 and offers residents $25 in drive credits when using the special promo code: NEDFREE_EV.

### Mountain Rides

Mountain Rides operates bus rides connecting Ward, Nederland, and Rollinsville every Wednesday and Thursday. The bus is wheelchair accessible, free, requires no prior registration, and is dog friendly, making it an accessible transportation option for many residents. On Thursday, Mountain Rides has the added benefit of helping people access the Food Pantry and Clothing Closet at the Community Center. On Wednesdays, it helps seniors access senior discount days at B&F and the senior lunch at the Nederland Community Center.

## Aging Organizations

### Mountain Peak Life – Nederland Area Seniors

The mission of Nederland Area Seniors, Inc. is to assist senior citizens in enhancing their quality of life, enabling them to live a life of respect and honor through the facilitation of nutrition, transportation, education, recreation, socialization, and outreach programs for all seniors living in the Nederland area.

### Boulder County – Area Agency on Aging

Boulder County is the official Area Agency on Aging (AAA) for Nederland. Their mission is to deliver, fund, and advocate for services that promote well-being, independence, and dignity for older adults, people living with disabilities, caregivers, and veterans in Boulder County. They provide several services including local resources, advocacy, assistance for caregivers, elder rights, LGBTQ+ outreach, a long-term care ombudsman, Medicare counseling, healthy aging, respite care, and veterans' services. The AAA also published a yearly annual report on aging and reports on aging trends for Boulder County. Boulder County is experiencing rapid aging, with the 80+ age group expected to increase 244% by 2050.

## Youth Organizations

### Teens Inc.

Teens Inc. is Nederland's primary youth service provider in Nederland, offering a variety of programs and services. Under the umbrella of Teens Inc. are three schools, two summer youth employment programs, and a variety of other initiatives. The primary four pillars of Teens Inc. are education, recreation, youth employment, and community initiatives such as the Nederland Youth Board and Mountain Coalition for Youth. The group advocates for Youth to have opportunities to socialize, recreate, gain work experience, and engage in decision-making in Nederland.

### Mountain Coalition for Youth

The Mountain Coalition for Youth is a community organizing coalition of partner organizations, civic leaders, and community members united by the mission of making the Nederland area a healthier, happier, and more socially connected place to be a young person. The Coalition focuses on three main goals: genuine youth leadership, youth opportunity, and social-emotional learning.

## Engagement Summary

### What Was Heard

From the combined survey and Open House results, when asked which service categories the Town should focus on providing, the most common answers were childcare, affordable housing support, and eldercare. When asked which services people must travel outside Nederland for, the main responses were pharmacy, urgent/emergency care, childcare, pre-school, physical therapy, exercise classes, and primary care.

These responses indicated a need for certain health and human services in Nederland, "but that is understandable" as one respondent wrote on the board, for some of these services to be missing given the size of the town. Pharmacy, daycare, and eldercare emerged as the most feasible primary needs/desires that could be supported in town.

### Stakeholder Meeting - Needs and Opportunities

Three main needs emerged from conversations with the Peak-to-Peak Housing and Human Services Alliance. Those needs were related to transportation, creating a human services hub for nonprofits to operate from, and increasing funding opportunities. Several member organizations present at the meeting agreed that transportation, including after-school transportation for kids, and getting from Ward to Nederland to Boulder without a car is a challenge. Those who are most in need of human services often do not have a car or the ability to drive, and due to the mountainous terrain and lack of transportation options in the Peak-to-Peak Region, accessible transportation remains a barrier to serving the community. On this point, some present at the meeting pointed out that Boulder Valley School District (BVSD) could become a partner in helping students get from school to after-school sports, services, and opportunities. The Mountain Rides program has been successful at starting to address this problem and is a well-utilized program.

Another primary desire the Alliance identified was having a human and social services hub for nonprofit organizations to operate from and collaborate. A lot of outreach events are currently operated from the Community Center, which has been effective given the central location, so the space would primarily be an office for internal operation.

This group of stakeholders also emphasized that funding is a challenge for maintaining and expanding operations. Several of the social service offerings in the Nederland area rely on donations, grants, and volunteerism. New ways of increasing revenue for key services would be advantageous.

Other specific ideas came up in the conversation, such as identifying gaps in service including a lack of dental and medical services, harm reduction and substance abuse programs, and in-home care and aging-in-place opportunities.

Finally, the Alliance emphasized that continued workforce housing availability remains a problem and impacts social and human services professionals who struggle to afford to live in the community. For example, providing better child and elder care, as well as having more medical services, would require better workforce housing availability.
