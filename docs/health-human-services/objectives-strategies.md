# Objectives & Strategies

## Objective 1: Create New Opportunities to Connect Residents with Local Service Providers

Through feedback collected for this comprehensive plan update, members of the community and key stakeholders described a need for more opportunities to connect service providers with residents beyond periodic tabling events at the Community Center. The Town of Nederland and Boulder County have an extensive network of service providers, and residents have expressed interest in understanding the resources available to them. The town could explore increasing the frequency of tabling events or providing more dedicated space for service providers to communicate and connect with Nederland residents.

## Objective 2: Ensure Community Design Supports People of All Ages, Incomes and Abilities

Livable communities support the thriving of people at all life stages, incomes, and abilities in their daily navigation of their community. AARP provides an easy-to-understand definition of a livable community, "one that is just as comfortable for an 80-year-old as an 8-year-old". The Town of Nederland should prioritize accessibility, and inclusion in community design and in land use and building regulations to ensure that residents are able to remain in Nederland and be well-supported by their community.

## Strategies

### Strategy 1: Amend Use Categories in Land Use Code to Support In-Home Service Providers

Engagement feedback with community members, and key stakeholders working in health and human services in the community have outlined the lack of available services such as childcare, physical therapy, and home health services. These services can be done in a mobile "on-call setting", or licensed practitioners or qualified service providers could be able to perform these services from their homes or accessory structures on their properties. As the Housing and Economic Development chapters have outlined, there are opportunities to reduce the regulatory barriers to allowing home health or childcare services in the use tables of Nederland's Land Development Code.

### Strategy 2: Complete a Boomer Bond Assessment

Like many communities, and the State of Colorado as a whole, the population of Nederland is getting older and adults over the age of 65 are forecasted to continue to be a growing share of the population over time. The Town of Nederland is in the Boulder County Area Agency on Aging (AAA) service area. The Boulder County AAA provides funding, advocacy, and services for older adults, people with disabilities, veterans, and refugees in Boulder County. The Boulder County AAA is distinct from the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) Area Agency on Aging. While not included in the DRCOG AAA, Nederland is a DRCOG member government and eligible to take advantage of DRCOG provided services and technical assistance. One such technical assistance tool offered by DRCOG is the Boomer Bond Community Assessment tool. The purpose of the Boomer Bond Assessment Tool is to help local governments and associated organizations evaluate their existing resources, plans, regulations, programs and community design to understand how their community serves older adult residents. After completing the assessment, local government staff and elected officials will have a comprehensive community assessment to guide decisions related to building a community that supports healthy aging. The assessment tool is designed to examine current circumstances and existing resources; understand community strengths and deficiencies; identify short- and long-term priorities; and confidently implement strategies that contribute to healthy, successful aging. The assessment can be completed as a self-assessment, or The town can work with DRCOG staff to complete the assessment.

### Strategy 3: Create a Nederland Human and Social Services Hub

Explore more permanent space for health, human, and social service providers to "set up shop" to reach community residents. Currently, outreach events are held in a non-permanent manner at the Nederland Community Center. While this is an effective way to reach folks, this method relies on people being available to attend these outreach events, knowing that the events are happening, and being at a convenient time. The creation of "hub" does not need to involve setting aside new space, it could look like allowing for outreach events to happen on a reoccurring basis once a week out of the Community Center, or it could look like providing an "information desk" in the Nederland Town Hall or Community center where residents can access information and learn about all of the service providers that are operating in Nederland and surrounding counties and provide a way to get in contact with service providers in the area.

### Strategy 4: Build Upon Transportation Connections

During the stakeholder feedback process, several stakeholders identified a need for more multimodal transportation connections to serve school kids and folks working in Nederland but employed outside of town. The Mountain Rides Program is already a great resource and is working to fulfill this need, however, future partnerships with the Boulder Valley School District could be pursued. Additionally, the Town of Nederland is working to complete a Multimodal Transportation Plan which outlines specific recommendations to improve the ability of people of all ages, incomes, and abilities to navigate Nederland and their daily lives effectively and sustainably.
