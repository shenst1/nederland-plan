# Existing Conditions & Key Issues

## Economic Development

### Town Budget and Fiscal Health

The 2022 Nederland financial report showed the Town of Nederland in good financial standing. In 2022, all tax revenue was up 6.9% compared to fiscal year 2021. As of December 31, 2022, the governmental funds held $2,967,060 in cash & investments and $504,356 in liabilities, meanwhile, the town's governmental activities fund held $5,956,862 in capital assets, a 12.5% increase; and $64,798 in long-term liabilities, a 58.07% decrease. Service revenue has increased, and program revenue has slightly decreased between 2021 and 2022. Overall, the town had a higher net position in 2022 than in 2021. This is indicative of the good fiscal health of the municipality.

In 2023 and 2024, tax revenue increases leveled out and remained roughly comparable to 2022 tax collections. Sales tax remains the highest source of on-going revenue, followed by property taxes, then law enforcement fines and fees. In 2023 and 2024, the Town of Nederland has seen significant increases in grant funding, 2.4 million, to the town's fund balance providing the Town historically high available capital budget allowance. Grants typically have specific timelines and categorical parameters around the use of funding; however, they can be a large contribution to the town's capital expenditure budget which funds new services and public infrastructure. In 2023, the town was able to outlay its largest capital expenditure amount in the last 5 years at $808,069. Continuing to find and apply for grant funding will be an important component in the funding and planning for new public infrastructure and services. Stakeholder feedback has revealed that Nederland has a significant amount of aging infrastructure. The maintenance of public infrastructure is typically not eligible for federal funding or grant funding. The town will need to continue to increase its tax revenue to keep up with existing and future maintenance obligations associated with public infrastructure and services to serve the economic development and overall quality of life needs of the Town.

### Employment & Income

Most workers in Nederland work remotely or are employed outside of town with very few people living and working in Nederland. As of 2021, 70.7% work in white-collar jobs, 10.6% work in blue-collar jobs, and 18.8% work in service positions. The area median income (AMI) in Nederland is $101,944 as of 2021 ACS data.

### Business Activities

The Town of Nederland is estimated to have around 102 total businesses. Most businesses, 58.6%, are service or retail businesses and 5% of businesses are restaurants or bars.

Downtown Nederland includes key businesses such as restaurants, bars, grocery stores and food co-ops, gift shops and retail. Some businesses missing from Nederland include health care services, including dentists and physical therapists, as well as auto-repair businesses, printing, and shipping. During engagement sessions most participants indicated that they want to see more businesses that can provide daily services to reduce trips to other Front Range communities and catalyze opportunities for local businesses to provide core services to Nederland residents.

### Tourism

The Town of Nederland was approved to participate in the Reimagine Destinations Program by the Colorado Tourism Office in July of 2022. This program offered the town free consulting and support in establishing leadership around tourism, as well as identifying opportunities to increase visitation and visitor satisfaction.

One key finding from this process is that Nederland does not currently have a tourism budget, a Chamber of Commerce, or any other entity responsible for marketing or managing tourism for the destination. As a result of the Reimagine Destinations Program, Nederland staff recommended that the Board of Trustees add a tourism line item to its 2023 budget.

The most popular tourism season for Nederland is summer (June through October). In 2022, visitation was higher than in previous years, with visitors from around Colorado making up the largest share of visitors, followed by those from Texas.

The Reimagine Destinations Program conducted a sentiment survey that was distributed in Nederland and surrounding areas in the fall of 2022 and received 265 resident responses. Most survey respondents agreed that tourism is important to Nederland's economy. Most respondents identified signage and infrastructure, particularly parking, as insufficient to meet the needs of visitors. In several open-ended questions, residents also emphasized the need to educate visitors on the responsible and respectful use and protection of Nederland's natural resources.

The Reimagine program also distributed a tourism stakeholder survey in the fall of 2022 to businesses and organizations directly contributing to the tourism industry in Nederland. The purpose of the survey was to receive input on the economic outlook, priority concerns, and opportunity areas for tourism-oriented businesses. The survey received 43 responses. Most respondents said that tourism is critical to the success of their business. A priority concern was resident sentiment and attitude towards tourism, in addition to concerns about hiring and retaining staff and the rising cost of supplies. Business respondents felt it was important to promote local businesses and activities, build local awareness of the value of tourism, and promote shoulder season tourism opportunities.

## Arts + Culture

### Nederland Public Arts Committee

The Nederland Public Art Committee is a volunteer-led committee functioning under the Nederland Downtown Development Authority to increase the visual beautification of the Downtown Nederland area. The mission also includes increasing awareness and appreciation of the Nederland area culture, including natural and cultural history, the ecological environment, music making, humor, and community eclecticism. Funds are collected and distributed for the creation and implementation of public artworks including public murals and other three-dimensional artworks throughout town.

### Arts and Culture - Organizations and Programs

- **Art at the Center** uses the Community Center as a place to highlight and support Nederland's image as an emerging artisan center. Beginning in 2009, Art at the Center has been an on-going success in town. Three times per year the Nederland Community Center and the volunteer Art Committee host a new Art at the Center show focusing on local artists. Nederland area artists are invited to participate via newspaper ads, word of mouth, and requests to local galleries. After the art goes up, the Community Center organizes a reception for the community honoring the featured artists. The art then remains on display for 3-4 months. Local artists have been very involved and enthusiastic about submitting their work.

- **Nederland Day of Art** is a summertime day-long festival dedicated to the celebration of local art. Local businesses are asked to participate by helping to showcase the work of local artists. Other parts of the festival have previously included an arts and crafts fair and show hosted by Art at the Center, live demos at various galleries around town, a mural walk with the Nederland Public Art committee, a reception at Kaleidoscope Fine Arts, a reception at the Nederland Community Presbyterian Church, live music around town, and "Take and Make Art Kits" at the library.

- **Backdoor Theater** is a small independent and non-profit movie theater operating out of the Nederland Community Center. Additionally, BDT provides performance and rehearsal space for local schools and community theater groups and donates space to non-profits and schools for special movie showings. The Theater is also host to an annual independent film festival, local independent film showings during the Frozen Dead Guy Days festival, and special events such as NedX, a forum showcasing female authors. The Theater is housed within the Nederland Community Center.

- **Kaleidoscope Gallery** is Nederland's primary fine art gallery. They display the work of over 30 local artists and host seasonal shows and classes. Kaleidoscope is heavily involved in the arts community in Nederland and offers local artists a place to sell work commercially in town.

- **Peak to Peak Music Education Association** is a non-profit organization founded in 2011. Their mission is to raise money for local kids' music programs by hosting musical events in the area. Their support of child music education strengthens the overall music community. This organization plays a key role in organizing NedFest, which is one of the events that helps fund their work with youth.

### Existing Events

- **NedFest** is a popular event in Nederland. 2023 was the first year NedFest came back to Nederland, after a long break starting in 2018 due to a lack of space at the prior venue, Barker Meadows Park. Now the festival is hosted at the Caribou Room and is officially titled "NedFest Family Reunion." NedFest is a family-friendly music festival with live performances, food trucks, artist booths for all ages, and craft breweries for anyone over 21.

- **NederDays** is an annual festival celebrating the culture and community of Nederland. Previous activities have included barn dances, a silent disco, a sledding course and competition, a snowy 5K run, ice carving, and a wood chopping competition. NederDays is an inclusive event for families focused on celebrating local businesses and community members.

- **High Peaks Art Festival** is an annual outdoor art festival held each summer in Nederland. Artists are invited to exhibit original fine art in a variety of mediums, and the show is juried to ensure quality. Organizers of the event focus on marketing to art connoisseurs from Colorado's Front Range community, inviting them to explore the arts and crafts of the high country. The High Peaks Art Festival provides an excellent opportunity for mountain artists to connect with art collectors.

- **4th Fridays** are an ongoing event that invites tenants of Caribou Village Shopping Center to collaborate each 4th Friday during the summer months to provide an interactive evening of live music, artist demonstrations, specials, and snacks.

- **Ned Ned Trailfest** is a running series that promotes fundraising for Teens Inc. and features three different race options, a 5K, 10K, and half marathon. The race routes go through Old Town Nederland, and along dirt roads, and single-track trails in Nederland. Ned Ned is a 42-year-old running tradition that brings many runners both in and outside of Nederland together and has won Elevation Outdoors Best of the Rockies in 2016 and 2017.

### Visitor Center

Nederland's Visitor Center serves as an important resource for managing and enhancing the town's tourism economy. Strategically located to provide information on area attractions, including outdoor recreation, cultural sites, local restaurants, and retail options, the center plays a crucial role in orienting visitors and enhancing their experience in Nederland. As the town looks to refine its approach to tourism management, there is a shift toward reducing the emphasis on merchandise sales and focusing more on providing relevant and timely information. This shift is aligned with the town's broader goals of sustainable tourism, ensuring that visitors are well-informed about local offerings while supporting the preservation of Nederland's unique character and natural environment. Continuing to invest in the Visitor Center is essential for managing the impacts of tourism while promoting the town's cultural and natural assets responsibly.

## Engagement Summary

### What Was Heard

When community members were asked what types of businesses they would like to see more of in Nederland, the top choices were pharmacies, local food provisions, and childcare. Several other specific gaps in business offerings were identified during the conversation: Car wash, medical services, glamping operation, auto mechanic, urgent care, printing shop, packaging shop, makers space, auto-parts store, housewares, bank, childcare, dentists, and lodging.

When asked about the kinds of economic development objectives that should be prioritized, Open House attendees generally favored pursuing land use changes that would grow Nederland's tax base and support the development of high-quality commercial space to attract new business types. Online survey respondents, however, preferred investing in streetscape design/active transportation and leveraging natural and recreational amenities to encourage tourism-related economic development. Several respondents wrote in comments regarding the need to annex certain areas like Cold Springs and Ridge Rd. to increase the tax base. Notably, very few respondents said they wanted to improve the visibility of Nederland to visitors through destination marketing.

### Economic Development Stakeholder Meeting

The economic development stakeholder meeting yielded several critical insights into the needs and opportunities for the local economy. The primary theme was the cost of housing, which makes it difficult to sustain a workforce or attract critical community positions. A lot of Nederland's business owners live in Gilpin County, not in Nederland; Nederland is unaffordable for them and their employees. This lack of affordability is a threat to the culture of Nederland and could drive out locals. Another common issue identified was issues with infrastructure in the downtown, including poor quality commercial space and the lack of sidewalks. This group confirmed that sidewalks are a top priority for the town and the DDA.

Another gap identified by the stakeholder group was a lack of classic economic and business development services/organizations. For example, there are no business support services, business or innovation incubators, or organizations focused on building skills in the workforce. Teens, inc. comes the closest to these services, offering some programs that train youth and connect them to employment opportunities.

### Arts and Culture Stakeholder Meeting

During our arts and culture stakeholder meeting, several attendees shared the sentiment that Nederland strongly values arts and felt that the town provides a supportive environment with funding and collaboration. A few prominent needs/opportunities emerged from the conversation. A major theme was the importance of events, especially those featuring live performances. Events are popular because they bring cultural experiences to residents, but there are problems with a lack of clear protocol as well as infrastructural issues with signage, parking, transportation access, venue, and overnight accommodation. Stakeholders all agreed it is important to view arts and culture as including music, theater, visual arts, cultural celebration, and history.

Another common theme was the desire for an arts district, with potential benefits for funding and brand identity. There was a related conversation about the NDDA boundary. Some stakeholders recommended that the NDDA redraw its boundary to be inclusive of key institutions like The Community Center, the Caribou Room, and the Wildbear Nature Center, so they can access funding for public art projects.

When asked about the important elements of history and culture in Nederland, the primary themes brought up included the history of music and music recording (especially blue grass and rock), indigenous culture and heritage, and mining history. Several individuals felt these historical elements should be prioritized in public art, and featured in events, such as the idea that the Steam Shovel from the mining museum should be run to celebrate mining culture at town events.
