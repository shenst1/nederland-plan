# Objectives & Strategies

Several of the economic development-related recommendations are closely intertwined with recommendations identified in the Land Use, Transportation, and Housing chapters of this comprehensive plan as well as the Downtown Subarea Plan.

## Objective 1: Diversify Local Business Offerings to Meet Resident Needs

Nederland's proximity to outdoor recreation access, scenic setting, and quirky, artistic atmosphere has historically advantaged businesses that can draw visitors and tourists such as food and beverage establishments, and retail shops. These business types account for 63.6% of businesses in Nederland. Despite this, a significant priority identified in community and stakeholder engagement is the need to add core businesses in Nederland. Several business types are missing from Nederland, requiring residents to go to larger markets (primarily Boulder and online services) to fulfill those needs. While Nederland may be too small to support the full-time establishment of some core business types, there is an economic cost to not supporting a diverse array of businesses in town in the form of "leakage" or the tendency to spend additional dollars on goods and services in an area where you go for work, or appointments such as dental visits. When residents commute to Boulder or another Front Range community to access a dentist, it is not uncommon for them to also do their shopping for clothing, groceries, haircuts, or other goods and services in the same community where their appointments or primary "draw" is located. There is also a social and equity cost to not having a diverse array of core services in town. As the population ages, and older adults make up a larger share of the population, it will become increasingly important to maintain a network of core services such as grocery stores, pharmacies, auto repair shops, medical services, etc. in a closer range of access to folks with decreased mobility.

## Objective 2: Creative Strategies for Supporting Local Business Operations

As noted in the Land Use chapter, there are opportunities available to remove regulatory barriers that prevent small businesses from operating in areas outside of commercial retail spaces, such as legalizing in-home childcare services. The areas zoned for commercial retail establishments in Nederland are primarily focused around the downtown area, and the availability of new retail or commercial space is limited and can be expensive. There may be opportunities in the long run as new multi-family housing units are developed to leverage a mix of uses and add commercial retail space to the ground floor of multi-family housing units, or to fill in more commercial businesses in currently vacant or underutilized parcels. In the short term, and to support the potential for more business offerings that meet the daily needs of residents, the town could examine ways to support businesses that can operate out of homes, basements, garages, accessory structures, or ADUs by removing regulatory restrictions and offering financial incentives to home-businesses.

## Objective 3: Prioritize Public Investments in the Public Realm

Large swaths of the economic core of Nederland, downtown, and adjacent neighborhoods, have aging public infrastructure and disconnected, inaccessible sidewalks that connect residents to Downtown. New public and private development could help improve Downtown infrastructure through impact fees or exactions that would require developers to build sidewalks or make improvements to the public realm adjacent to the new development which could help make downtown more accessible and desirable for residents to access existing and new businesses. There has been a strong interest among stakeholders and community members in having more locally serving businesses. Providing better access from residential portions of town to the economic core may spur new business interest in Nederland. The Nederland Multimodal Transportation Plan and Downtown Subarea Plan outline several specific public realm improvements including identifying priority sidewalk improvements, new circulation patterns on downtown streets, and ways of increasing multimodal connectivity to and through downtown. Implementing the recommendations from these plans will help the Town of Nederland achieve the objective of prioritizing municipal investment in the public realm.

## Objective 4: Leverage Partnerships Between Businesses and Cultural and Recreational Events

The Town of Nederland is fortunate to have a diverse range of cultural and recreational event offerings year-round. Leveraging these events, and other natural and cultural resources to find opportunities for enhancing the economic condition in Nederland will benefit both the business community to throw events, increase public arts and culture offerings, and collaborate on projects that increase the visibility and desirability of Downtown.

## Objective 5: Maintain and Enhance Key Community Facilities Including the Visitor Center

Following strategies from the Utilities chapter, Nederland will prioritize the renovation and expansion of key community facilities. The Visitor Center will continue to serve as a hub for managing tourism, with a focus on offering useful information and reducing emphasis on merchandise sales. Seeking grant funding for facility upgrades will be a critical part of this strategy, ensuring that these spaces remain welcoming and functional for both residents and visitors.

## Strategies

### Strategy 1: Implement Recommendations from The Downtown Subarea Plan

The Downtown Subarea Plan highlights the opportunity to increase business diversity downtown, and what types of businesses fit the identified downtown character areas. Since downtown Nederland is the economic center of town, following these guidelines for new development and redevelopment opportunities along with opportunities to support existing businesses.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objectives 1 and 3

### Strategy 2: Implement Recommendations from the Nederland Tourism Management Strategy

The Nederland Tourism Management Strategy (NTMS) serves as a framework for managing and responsibly promoting tourism in Nederland and the surrounding area. The purpose of the strategy is to provide a three-year roadmap for the Town of Nederland and its community partners to actively engage in tourism management and improve communications with visitors. The overall aim is to generate visitor spending and enhance travel experiences while preserving the town's cultural heritage and environment. The NTMS identifies six goals aligned with Nederland's 2030 vision focused on responsible tourism management. Each goal is supported by specific strategies, actions, recommended partners, resources, and a timeline, along with Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to track progress.

**NTMS Goals:**
- **Engage Community Partners and Businesses:** Establish clear methods to share information and engage with tourism and community stakeholders effectively. Provide consistent updates on NTMS progress and build local awareness and engagement around tourism management and marketing efforts. Partner to expand business support resources and incentives for new and established tourism-related businesses.

- **Educate and Manage Visitors:** Create and distribute responsible and respectful use education materials based on identified principles. Collaborate with partners to improve wayfinding and interpretive signage in and near town. Improve Visitor Center resources and services.

- **Promote Local Businesses and Experiences:** Launch a Visit Nederland website that features trip planning information, local businesses, events, experiences, and responsible visitor messaging. Encourage local businesses and organizations to use Nederland's new brand logo and visual assets. Develop unique campaigns and resources to promote businesses and experiences, particularly in the spring and fall seasons.

- **Improve the Community and Visitor Experience:** Host new and streamline management and promotion of events and festivals. Collaborate on projects to improve and protect cultural and social assets in the community. Collaborate on projects to steward trails and open space. Explore the development of new attractions and experiences.

- **Conduct Research, Impact Monitoring and Reporting:** Conduct research on tourism funding options and establish a long-term strategy for sustainable tourism management and marketing funding.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objectives 2, 3, 4 & 5

### Strategy 3: Wayfinding and Signage

During the stakeholder feedback sessions, participants expressed that the town was lacking in wayfinding signage that oriented visitors to key nodes and destinations in Nederland. As the Town of Nederland and the NDDA continue to invest in sidewalk infrastructure and plan for bicycle and pedestrian connections to Downtown, and important consideration will be the development of a branded wayfinding signage plan that will orient visitors and residents to key nodes and destinations in town. Further, this recommendation builds upon a recommended action from the NTMS. To increase capture of tourist travel along the Peak-to-Peak Highway, or coming to Nederland from Boulder, the town should consider investing in a well-designed suite of vehicular-oriented roadway guide signs that orient visitors to key nodes and destinations in town, so that folks that are "traveling through" are more likely to linger. Signs used for vehicular orientation must comply with roadway signage standards and guidelines that are regulated by State, County, or Municipal transportation departments, however, the bicycle and pedestrian wayfinding signs that are not installed along roadways are less restricted by such standards, and pose an opportunity to partner with local artists, or schools groups to come up with a theme and branding to elevate the image of the town, and show-off the creative culture of Nederland.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 3

### Strategy 4: Prioritize Parking and Sidewalk Improvements

Prioritize parking improvements (such as recommendations found in Nederland's 2010 Parking Study and the recommendations from the 2024 Multimodal Transportation Plan), including centralized parking "pods" along the outskirts of downtown that encourage people to get out of their car and explore Nederland's businesses and amenities. An example could include reclaiming the area adjacent to the "Welcome to Nederland" sign as a potential parking pod. The Town of Nederland should also continue to identify future opportunities to improve pedestrian and drainage improvements throughout the town, including paving existing crusher fins paths that resulted from the "NedPeds" Plan that is currently (2012-2014). Further, implement sidewalk improvements pertaining to 2nd Street as a connection between the Library, Post Office, and transit stops, specifically. Continue to promote improvements to pathways for non-motorized circulation, consistent with the Trails Master Plan, as well as pedestrian improvements throughout the central Business District. Continue to explore the potential for a connected trail system along Barker Reservoir's perimeter eventually connecting Big Springs with the central Business District.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 3

### Strategy 5: Colorado Main Streets Program

The Colorado Main Street Program is administered by the Division of Local Government within the Colorado Department of Local Affairs and offers support for community-led downtown revitalization. The goal of Colorado Main Streets is to assist communities across the State committed to creating high-quality places and to building stronger communities through preservation-based economic development. Communities can apply to be an affiliated Main Street Community through Colorado Main Streets. Official Main Street communities receive a full range of technical assistance, training, consulting services, mini grants (ranging from $2,500 to $10,000 annually), and scholarships. The application requires you to have a steering committee or board of directors, volunteers or staff who have reviewed the Main Street Approach, a dedicated champion to act as a point of contact, a strategic plan, community awareness, and support from the public and private sectors. The Main Street: Open for Business Grant Program, enabled by Senate Bill 21-252, awarded money to eligible entities (municipalities, counties, and councils of government), to provide incentive programs for local business owners to improve the energy efficiency and/or aesthetics of commercial buildings within traditional downtowns. This program was designed to increase property values and visual appeal, increase sales and revenues in rehabilitated buildings, reduce energy consumption and lower utility bills, and increase job retention/creation. The Town could consider affiliating as a Main Street Community to unlock funding and technical assistance from the Division of Local Government in order to catalyze new economic development opportunities in Downtown Nederland.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objectives 2 and 3

### Strategy 6: Import-replacement Tactics

Implement strategies to reduce economic leakage by encouraging residents to shop locally for goods and services that are currently purchased outside of Nederland. This could include promoting local businesses, creating incentives for local shopping, and supporting businesses that provide core services needed by residents.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objectives 1 and 2

### Strategy 7: Hire a Town Grants Coordinator

Hire a dedicated grants coordinator to help identify, apply for, and manage grant funding opportunities that can support economic development, infrastructure improvements, and community facilities.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 3

### Strategy 8: Explore Creative Funding Strategies

Explore innovative funding mechanisms such as tax increment financing, business improvement districts, or other tools to support economic development and public realm improvements.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objectives 1 and 3

### Strategy 9: Create an Arts + Culture District

Explore the creation of a formal arts and culture district that could provide funding opportunities, brand identity, and support for arts and cultural activities. Consider expanding the NDDA boundary to include key cultural institutions like the Community Center, Caribou Room, and Wildbear Nature Center.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objectives 4 & 5

### Strategy 10: Visitor Center Management

Continue to invest in and enhance the Visitor Center as a hub for tourism management, focusing on providing useful information to visitors while reducing emphasis on merchandise sales. Ensure the Visitor Center serves as an effective tool for managing tourism impacts and promoting responsible visitor behavior.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 5

### Strategy 11: Explore Opportunities for More Resident-Focused Events

Work with community organizations and businesses to develop and support events that primarily serve local residents, creating opportunities for community connection and local economic activity.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objectives 4 & 5
