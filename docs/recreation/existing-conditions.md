# Existing Conditions & Key Issues

## The Recreation Landscape

As a result of its position surrounded by public lands and breathtaking mountain scenery, much of Nederland's recreational opportunities are defined by outdoor offerings such as hiking, mountain biking, and skiing. Traditional recreation, like sports programming, classes and clinics, and athletic facilities, are also a crucial part of recreation in Nederland but are less developed than the outdoor recreation opportunities are. When considering the recreation opportunities available to residents in Nederland, it is important to consider the regional scale due to the abundance of trails and public lands outside town boundaries. These recreational features, though under the control of other governing bodies such as the United States Forest Service (USFS) and Boulder County, play an important role in supplementing in-town recreational offerings.

## Sports Fields, Playgrounds, & Recreational Amenities

Nederland has several parks that offer residents access to sports fields and courts, playgrounds, skateparks, picnic tables, and natural scenery. The Guercio Memorial Park, Nederland Ice and Racquet Park, and Nederland Middle-High School offer residents access to various fields and courts such as a baseball field, tennis courts, and ice rink, and a well-maintained track and football field.

Nederland's main park is Chipeta Park, which includes picnic tables, a shelter, play equipment, swings, and a small pond. It is easily accessible from First Street and Downtown via pedestrian trails. Adjacent to Chipeta Park is Veterans Memorial Park, featuring trails, benches, and a veteran's memorial. Joe Smith Park, the Nathan Lazarus Skatepark, Tom Riley Park, and various pocket parks provide additional in-town recreational spaces.

## Outdoor Recreation

Nederland has an extensive, though incomplete, pedestrian dirt trail system that connects key destinations like Downtown, Chipeta Park, Boulder Creek, neighborhoods, and the Community Center. This network enhances connectivity and offers pleasant walking experiences in town.

Outside of town there are several large open spaces and public lands with trail networks providing access to hiking, mountain biking, and scenic views. These include the West Magnolia trails (USFS), Mud Lake (Boulder County), Barker Reservoir Recreation Area (City of Boulder), and Caribou Ranch Open Space (Boulder County).

Outdoor recreation opportunities in the area can draw significant visitation and drives tourism. For example, in the winter Eldora Mountain resort and Nordic skiing opportunities on the 4th of July Road and Mud Lake Open Space bring several visitors. In the summer, mountain biking, camping, fishing, and hunting draw several visitors to public lands in the area such as the Indian Peaks Wilderness. Boulder Canyon provides ample opportunities for rock climbing as a premier climbing destination with hundreds of sport and traditional routes between Boulder and Nederland.

## Key Issues Identified

### Maintenance, Funding, and Capacity

Funding and staff capacity are the core challenges in the maintenance and delivery of recreational assets in town. However, continued efforts to find funding through grants could help provide new recreational assets, and non-profits and volunteer groups are excellent resources to continue maintaining existing trails and parks in town. Before building new infrastructure, maintenance of existing parks and facilities is the top priority. Proposals for new facilities should only move forward when there are clear mechanisms for initial funding as well as continued operations and maintenance of the facility.

### Tourism Impacts and Opportunities

Because the recreational offerings around Nederland are so desirable, they serve not only as local destinations but also as tourist destinations. Traffic from Front-Range communities visiting Eldora Mountain Resort and nearby trailheads presents challenges with congestion but also provides economic opportunities for travel and tourism-supporting industries.

### Indoor Recreation Facility Needs and Upgrades

The two most significant recreation facility needs in Nederland are an indoor pool and upgrades to the Community Center. In 2024, the community's most frequently expressed need was for a pool, hot tub, and sauna facility, a recommendation also highlighted in the 2013 PROST plan.

The Community Center, a central hub for recreation, offers a fitness center and various sports, dance, and social programs. However, it requires several renovations to maintain its functionality, including addressing the condemned West Wing and improving site circulation. Addressing these issues will ensure the Community Center continues to meet the community's recreational needs.

### Outdoor Recreation Facility Needs and Upgrades

Community members have expressed interest in developing the west shore of Barker Meadow Reservoir to provide water-based recreational opportunities and create a direct link to Downtown. Currently, swimming and boating at the reservoir are prohibited. Although a master plan was created in 2013 to revitalize this area, those improvements have not been implemented. Despite financial and intergovernmental challenges, there is ongoing interest in adding trails around the reservoir and developing a performance stage in the proposed Gateway Park area.

In 2024, the most frequently expressed outdoor recreation need was for increased pedestrian trail connectivity in town. While Nederland has a unique system of gravel paths linking key neighborhoods to Downtown and Chipeta Park, there are gaps in the network, and the trails lack ADA accessibility. Improving trail connectivity was also a key objective in the 2013 PROST plan.

## Engagement Recap

The following section summarizes the emerging themes from our community engagement around the topic of recreation. For more information about our engagement process, please read the community engagement summary in the introduction chapter.

### What Was Heard

When asked what kind of indoor and outdoor recreational offerings are currently missing in Nederland, there was strong support for the idea of developing a swimming pool facility of some kind. The survey strongly supported this outcome, with 15 out of 36 write-in comments specifically mentioning the desire for an indoor pool facility. Other common responses included a dog park, pump track, and outdoor event space/stage. There was also a significant number of respondents indicating a need for expanding the in-town pedestrian trails with better connectivity to neighborhoods like the Big Springs Community, increasing the accessibility of trail networks, and better wayfinding. When asked to prioritize which initiatives to focus on related to parks and recreation, the most support was for strategies like maintaining indoor and outdoor recreation facilities and local trail systems. New facilities were less of a priority, except for indoor recreation facilities and new trail connections to surrounding public lands which were still rated highly. When asked questions about maintaining facilities or developing new ones, there was a slight preference for maintaining existing facilities as a priority.

Overall, the responses were indicative of a community that values recreation and open space in general, with particular emphasis on conservation, developing trails, and maintaining existing facilities. Additional recreational programming and educational initiatives were the only policies that the community did not identify as particularly important.
