# Objectives & Strategies

## Objective 1: Prioritize the Maintenance and Operations of Successful Pre-Existing Recreation Facilities

Nederland will prioritize maintaining and enhancing existing recreational facilities to ensure they continue offering high-quality experiences for residents and visitors. The primary focus will be on key amenities such as Chipeta Park, the Community Center, and town trails along Central Boulder Creek, given their high usage and significance to the community. Securing the necessary funding and staffing to maintain these facilities is the critical first priority before considering the development of new recreational amenities. Efforts will also include community engagement through volunteer programs and the reassessment of less successful programs to reinvest resources where they are most effective.

## Objective 2: Support and Expand Indoor Recreation Opportunities

Nederland will emphasize opportunities to expand and support indoor recreation opportunities. While outdoor recreation opportunities already abound, indoor activities for residents during colder months are more limited. To expand these opportunities, the town will work to renovate and improve the Community Center, ensuring high-quality programmable space for fitness classes, social events and activities, and more. The maintenance of existing recreation facilities will be a funding priority, with new programs and facilities typically needing additional fundraising efforts such as through grants, donations, or the intentional allocation of parks budget whenever possible. Nederland Staff will investigate opportunities for a community pool facility.

**Connection to Resilience:** Health and Well-being

## Objective 3: Incrementally Improve In-Town Trail Networks and Pocket Parks

Nederland will prioritize the gradual expansion and enhancement of its in-town trail network and pocket parks to improve connectivity and accessibility. The Town will actively seek opportunities to connect existing trails to new key destinations and neighborhoods, ensuring that residents and visitors can easily navigate between parks, plazas, downtown areas, and neighborhoods on foot.

As outlined in the Downtown Subarea Plan, potential locations for pocket parks and plazas within the downtown subarea will be identified, evaluated, and developed incrementally. The focus will be on creating a cohesive network of trails and green spaces that enhance the pedestrian experience and provide accessible recreational areas throughout town.

## Objective 4: Expand Outdoor Recreation Offerings Near Barker Meadow Reservoir

Celebrate Barker Meadow and the reservoir as the eastern entrance to Nederland through continued efforts to enhance the area's natural beauty and to sustainably satisfy several of Nederland's cultural and recreational needs. Nederland will actively pursue the expansion of recreational opportunities between the west end of Barker Meadow Reservoir and the eastern edge of downtown. Key areas of focus will include evaluating the feasibility of developing an amphitheater and multi-use field space for community events and recreational activities.

In alignment with the recommendations of the Downtown Subarea Plan, the town will consider master planning this zone to create a cohesive connection between the reservoir as a recreational asset and downtown as the town center. This will involve a comprehensive approach to land use, infrastructure, and design, ensuring that these areas complement one another and enhance the overall experience for residents and visitors.

Nederland will also continue discussions with the City of Boulder to renegotiate agreements that could expand recreational uses of the reservoir, including the possibility of introducing paddle sports and swimming. This effort will involve exploring regulatory, environmental, and safety considerations to ensure that any new activities are sustainable and beneficial for the community.

## Strategies

### Strategy 1: Maintenance and Operations Plan

Develop detailed maintenance priorities and operating plans for the upkeep of existing trails and parks. This plan should include regular assessments of facility conditions, a maintenance schedule, and a resource allocation strategy.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 1

### Strategy 2: Program Evaluation and Reinvestment

Identify the most and least successful recreation programs based on popularity, community impact, and satisfaction levels. Prioritize and reinvest in successful programs while considering the discontinuation of less effective ones to redirect funds to higher-impact areas.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 1

### Strategy 3: Develop a Trail and Park Maintenance Volunteer Program

Develop a robust volunteer program focused on trail and park maintenance. Engage residents, community groups, and schools in organized efforts to maintain and enhance town trails and parks. Offer training, tools, and incentives to volunteers, and establish a regular schedule for volunteer maintenance events.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 1

### Strategy 4: Budget Exploration

Explore opportunities to increase the parks and recreation budget, with a focus on securing funds for maintenance. Once maintenance liabilities are adequately covered, investigate options for future investments in recreational facilities.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 1

### Strategy 5: Community Center Renovation Plan

Develop and implement a comprehensive renovation plan for the Community Center, focusing on creating versatile, high-quality spaces for fitness, social events, and community programs. This plan should include upgrades to existing facilities, improved accessibility, and renovations to the west wing.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 2

### Strategy 6: Feasibility Study for Indoor Pool

Conduct a feasibility study to investigate the potential for developing an indoor pool facility. This study should assess community demand, site suitability, cost estimates, and potential funding sources. Engage with community members and stakeholders to gauge interest and gather input.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 2

### Strategy 7: Trail Network Expansion Plan

Establish a formal plan to expand the in-town trail network, prioritizing connections to key destinations like schools, parks, downtown, and residential neighborhoods. This plan would include a phased timeline for implementation, funding sources, and specific areas targeted for new trails.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 3

### Strategy 8: Green Open Space Development

Integrate green infrastructure and sustainable practices into the development of trails, pocket parks, and plazas. This could include using permeable materials, native landscaping, and stormwater management systems.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 3

### Strategy 9: Barker Reservoir Feasibility Study

Conduct a feasibility study for the development of an amphitheater and multi-use field space. Start with the Nederland Gateway Park Area Master Plan from 2013 and evaluate what concepts are still feasible and which are not. This updated effort should assess site suitability, potential environmental impacts, cost estimates, and community demand. Secure funding for the study through grants or partnerships and engage consultants with expertise in recreational planning and design.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 4

### Strategy 10: Intergovernmental Collaboration with Boulder

Continue negotiations with the City of Boulder to explore the potential for expanding recreational activities at Barker Meadow Reservoir, such as paddle sports and swimming. This effort should include discussions on regulatory, environmental, and safety considerations to ensure any new activities are sustainable and beneficial for the community.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 4
