# Recreation

This chapter lays the foundation for the vision, goals, and policies that will direct Nederland's approach to recreation initiatives within the town and surrounding lands. The concepts in this chapter were developed through conversations with stakeholders about the needs of the community, an analysis of existing recreation offerings, and public input on needs, opportunities, and top priorities for recreation. This chapter includes actionable policies to advance Nederland's recreation goals and offerings. These policies are intended to help keep Nederland active, engaged in the community, and physically and mentally healthy through both active and passive recreation options. A thriving recreation scene contributes to human health and wellbeing, a core pillar of the City Resilience Index.

## Recreation Vision Statement

> Our community and its visitors enjoy a well-connected, ecologically sound, well-maintained, and accessible parks, open space, and trail system with recreational and cultural services and facilities while protecting and enhancing the unique mountain ecosystem of which we are a part.
