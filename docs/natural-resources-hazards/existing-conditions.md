# Existing Conditions & Key Issues

## Natural Resources

### Habitat, Biodiversity, and Ecology

The natural environment surrounding Nederland consists primarily of Rocky Mountain Ponderosa Pine Woodland and Lodgepole Pine Forests. Lodgepole pine forests, common at higher elevations, are fire-dependent ecosystems, while Ponderosa Pine woodlands, found at lower elevations, host several rare plant species. These forests, along with the wetlands and areas of high biodiversity near Nederland, are crucial to the region's ecological health.

Surrounding Nederland are several designated wetlands and areas of high or very high biodiversity significance as identified by the Colorado Conservation Data Explorer (CODEX) drawing on data from Colorado Parks and Wildlife and the US Fish and Wildlife Service. In addition, there are several elk migration corridors on the outskirts of town. It is important to avoid disrupting these key parts of the natural landscape by discouraging development or growth in these locations.

Middle Boulder Creek and North Beaver Creek, the two riparian zones intersecting Nederland, provide valuable wetland habitat. These habitats are both ecologically productive and valuable while also providing the town with excellent natural and scenic amenities.

The town's 2016 Riparian & Wetland Habitat Assessment by Western Ecological Resource, Inc. emphasized the need to minimize impacts on wetlands, particularly the fragile Fen Wetland northeast of the Boulder Creek Lodge (previously Magnuson Hotel). Recommendations include avoiding development in sensitive areas, encouraging the planting of native species, and removing invasive weeds. Additionally, the assessment suggests restoring floodplains, stabilizing creek banks, and enhancing public awareness through educational signage.

While these recommendations provide a framework for stewardship, the overarching goal is to balance human use with the preservation of these natural resources, ensuring they remain vital and healthy for future generations.

## Climate and Environmental Hazards

### Climate Change

In a business-as-usual scenario, by the year 2050, Boulder County can expect to see warmer temperatures and, while potentially slightly more total precipitation, more dry days on average. The starkest climate shift in Boulder County will be temperature, with the annual average daily maximum temperature rising from 56.8 (1961-1990 observed average) to 63 degrees Fahrenheit. Generally, the future is expected to have wetter springs and drier falls, a pattern that typically increases the chances of wildfire and contributed to the Boulder County Marshall Fire in 2021. According to the CU Boulder Center for Sustainable Landscapes and Communities in 2020, "Climate change is known to increase uncertainty when it comes to weather expectations - a trend we are seeing in Boulder County. Thirty years of precipitation data show that dry years are getting drier, wet years are getting wetter, and drought and flood events are becoming increasingly difficult to predict."

Besides increasing heat, Boulder County is expecting impacts from climate change including increased frequency and intensity of flooding, longer periods of drought, more wildfires, more frequent beetle infestations, and water shortages. Wildfires are already burning twice as many acres each year as compared to 1980. Colorado's precipitation is 20% lower than it was in the last century, and decreasing snowpack makes it harder to keep water resources in the county during increasingly hot summers.

The impacts of climate change can cost human health, well-being, and safety as well as the economic productivity of important industries; especially skiing and agriculture in Boulder County. The awareness of the impacts of climate change and increasing uncertainty around environmental hazards is a core reason resilience is the framework of this plan and the driving value for Nederland's future.

### Wildfire

Wildfire is a significant threat to the Town of Nederland, which is located entirely within the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI), an area at high risk of wildfires. The 2011 Community Wildfire Protection Plan (CWPP) identified Nederland's surrounding ecosystems as highly flammable due to typical montane and upper montane fuels, combined with factors like weather and topography. The short fire season and the risk of fires spreading uphill increase the vulnerability of neighborhoods situated on higher slopes.

According to the CWPP, all areas of Nederland have high to extreme wildfire hazard ratings. The town is served by the Nederland Fire Protection District, which operates three fire stations equipped with various fire engines and water tenders. While the CWPP commends the Fire Protection District for its strong firefighter training, it also suggests further training and equipment enhancements.

### Flood

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provides hydraulic modeling studies for communities across the US, which are aggregated into the National Flood Hazard Layer. These models help support the National Flood Insurance Program and can help individual developers and communities understand their type of flooding risk.

According to the most recent FEMA flood model for Nederland, completed in 2012, some parts of Nederland are within the 0.2% and 1% annual chance floodplain of Middle Boulder Creek and North Beaver Creek. However, their model shows these floodplains do not generally deviate far from the stream channel. This indicates that floods are likely to stay close to the stream banks, and the area of the floodplain is relatively small. Downtown Nederland is the most impacted by potential flooding, and the risk is most pronounced for the properties around North Beaver Creek, where there are 26 structures currently in the flood plain.

### Evacuation Capacity

In 2023, the Town of Nederland commissioned The Ember Alliance to model potential evacuation times and roadway congestion for the Nederland and Timberline Fire Protection Districts (FPDs).

The four modeled scenarios concluded that evacuating residents during a wildfire in the FPDs could take between 2.25 and 3.75 hours. The roads with the highest potential for extreme congestion were the following:

- Highway 72 (Peak to Peak Highway, West 2nd Street, and Coal Creek Canyon Road)
- Highway 119 (Boulder Canyon Drive and North Bridge Street)
- County Road 122 (Sugarloaf Road)
- Eldora Road
- Magnolia Drive

The following three locations were identified as locations that could experience substantial roadside hazards during a wildfire and may benefit from alternate egress routes:

- The area around Eldora Mountain
- Lazy Z Neighborhood
- Big Springs Neighborhood
