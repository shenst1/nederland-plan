# Natural Resources & Hazards

On the one hand, Nederland's position in a high-alpine environment blesses it with outstanding scenery and the opportunity to preserve important natural habitats and ecosystems. On the other hand, the dynamic nature of the surroundings leaves Nederland vulnerable to certain hazards such as wildfire and flooding. This chapter charts a path forward for stewarding the natural landscape and building the resilience to handle its natural hazards. In summary, this chapter is about living in harmony with the natural landscape. The concepts in this chapter were developed through conversations with stakeholders about the needs of the community and an analysis of existing resources and exposure to potential hazards. It takes into account a basic understanding of hazard risk exposure, habitat significance, and the future impacts of climate change. This chapter includes actionable policies to advance Nederland's environmental resilience and are intended to keep Nederland and the surrounding environment safe and resilient.
