# Objectives & Strategies

## Objective 1: Ensure Water Resource Resilience and Long-term Sufficiency

A wildfire in the upper Central Boulder Creek watershed poses a significant risk to Nederland's water supply, potentially compromising access to clean water. To address this priority, Nederland will prioritize the development of infrastructure that mitigates this risk, such as enhancing water intake protection and securing additional water storage options. This objective overlaps with Objective 1 in the Utilities, Facilities, and Water Resources chapter. More specific strategies and actions are available in that chapter.

## Objective 2: Protect and Enhance Ecological Health and Biodiversity

Ecological health and biodiversity are very important to the community; biodiversity provides ecosystem services, resilience to environmental changes, improved quality of life, and upholds the inherent rights of nature. Nederland will focus on preserving and restoring critical habitats, wetlands, and other areas of high biodiversity significance. Furthermore, the town will minimize human impacts on ecological areas to enhance natural processes and avoid human interference to the greatest extent possible. Strategic development restrictions and habitat restoration projects will drive the ecological health of the town, with a special focus on protecting and restoring wetlands and the Central Boulder Creek corridor.

**Connection to Resilience:** Infrastructure and Ecosystems

## Objective 3: Enhance Wildfire Preparedness and Mitigation

Nederland will strengthen its wildfire preparedness and mitigation efforts by adopting fire-resistant building codes, enhancing fuel reduction programs, and updating the Community Wildfire Protection Plan (CWPP). The town will collaborate with local fire protection districts to conduct regular community education, evacuation drills, and training to ensure residents are equipped to respond effectively in the event of a wildfire. Additionally, Nederland will prioritize identifying and implementing defensible space initiatives around critical infrastructure and residential areas to reduce wildfire risk and protect lives and property.

## Objective 4: Reduce Flood Risk and Enhance Flood Resilience

Nederland will proactively reduce flood risk by enforcing stringent development controls in flood-prone areas, upgrading stormwater management systems, and promoting natural flood mitigation measures such as wetland preservation, riparian buffer restoration, and integrating green infrastructure into town projects. The town will also collaborate with regional and federal agencies to update floodplain maps and enhance flood forecasting and warning systems. These actions will help protect people, property, and infrastructure from flood hazards while enhancing the town's overall flood resilience.

## Objective 5: Improve Emergency Evacuation, Preparedness, and Response Capacity

Nederland will enhance its emergency evacuation and response capacity by improving key evacuation routes, developing alternative egress options, and addressing potential roadside hazards identified in recent evacuation models. The town will also strengthen its emergency communication systems to ensure timely and effective dissemination of information during crises. Regular community drills and training will be conducted to prepare residents and first responders for a range of emergency scenarios, ensuring a coordinated and efficient response in the event of an evacuation.

## Strategies

### Strategy 1: Implement Strategy 1: "Develop a Water System Resilience Plan" from the Utilities and Water Resources Chapter

Develop and implement infrastructure improvements to protect Nederland's water intake system from wildfire-related debris and other upstream hazards. For more information, reference the corresponding strategy in the Utilities, Facilities, and Water Resources chapter.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 1

### Strategy 2: Implement Strategy 2: "Reservoir Development Feasibility Study" from the Utilities and Water Resources Chapter

For more information, reference the corresponding strategy in the Utilities, Facilities, and Water Resources chapter.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 1

### Strategy 3: Riparian Buffer and Wetland Restoration

Restore and preserve riparian buffers and wetlands as natural flood mitigation measures. Focus on areas along Middle Boulder Creek and North Beaver Creek, integrating these efforts with broader habitat restoration projects. Refer to the recommendations from the town's 2016 Riparian & Wetland Habitat Assessment to identify priority projects for habitat restoration while balancing the enjoyment of recreational trails.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objectives 2 and 5

### Strategy 4: Wetland Protection Ordinance

Develop and adopt a wetland protection ordinance that restricts development in and around designated wetlands and biodiversity hotspots. The ordinance should include guidelines for buffer zones, development setbacks, and penalties for non-compliance.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objectives 2 and 5

### Strategy 5: Educational Signage and Public Awareness

Install educational signage around key ecological areas to raise public awareness of the importance of preserving these environments. These signs should highlight local biodiversity, the role of wetlands in flood mitigation, and actions the public can take to support conservation efforts.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 2

### Strategy 6: Fire-resistant Building Code

Update and enforce fire-resistant building codes, particularly in high-risk zones (such as Mountain Residential). These codes should include requirements for fire-resistant materials, defensible space, vegetation management, and other fire mitigation measures.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 3

### Strategy 7: CWPP Revision and Implementation

A new CWPP plan is currently in the process of being updated. The town will continue to coordinate with the Nederland Fire Protection District to ensure the new CWPP reflects the current risks and best practices and provides a clear action plan to address the needs of the community. The town will coordinate with NFPD to work on high-priority recommended projects such as fuel reduction and fire break projects.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 3

### Strategy 8: Stormwater Management System Upgrades

Upgrade Nederland's stormwater management systems to handle increased runoff and reduce flood risk. This includes installing green infrastructure, such as permeable pavements and rain gardens, and improving drainage capacity in flood-prone areas.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 4

### Strategy 9: Floodplain Development Controls

Restrict development in flood-prone areas by continuing to enforce strict development controls within floodplains, ensuring that new construction adheres to flood-resistant standards. Collaborate with FEMA and Boulder County to update and expand floodplain maps.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 4

### Strategy 10: Emergency Communication System Enhancements

Strengthen and regularly test emergency communication systems to ensure timely and effective dissemination of information during crises. This includes updating communication technologies and ensuring redundancy in communication channels. Under emergency management conditions, continue to work with the Boulder County Sheriff's Department Emergency Communications Center, the Nederland Fire Protection District, and the State Forest Service to improve the reliability and adequacy of emergency communications, preparedness, and notification to the public within the Nederland area.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 5

### Strategy 11: Second Bridge for Egress and Evacuation

Plan and construct a second bridge to serve as an additional egress and evacuation route. This infrastructure project will enhance community resilience by providing alternative access during emergencies.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 5

### Strategy 12: Hazard Mitigation and Evacuation Preparedness Education

Provide educational materials to residents (especially new residents) about evacuation procedures. Develop and implement an educational program to inform residents and property owners about best practices for reducing wildfire hazard exposure and vulnerability. The program will focus on:

a. **Building Materials and Construction:** Providing guidance on using fire-resistant materials and construction techniques, including non-combustible roof assemblies, eaves, vents, gutters, exterior walls, windows, and surface coverings, to improve the resilience of homes and buildings.

b. **Vegetation Management:** Offering resources and advice on effective vegetation management, such as tree thinning, spacing, limbing, and trimming, the removal of ladder fuels, surface vegetation clearance, and brush management. Encourage the adoption of vegetation conversion and fuel modification techniques to create defensible spaces around properties.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 5
