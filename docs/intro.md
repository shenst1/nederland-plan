# Town of Nederland Comprehensive Plan

## 2024 Update

Welcome to the Town of Nederland Comprehensive Plan. This document guides land use policy, future growth, development, and preservation for the community over the coming years.

## About This Plan

A comprehensive plan is a document that guides land use policy, future growth, development, and preservation for a community over several years. The community planning process involves a combination of public engagement and analysis and is designed to draw out public priorities such as land use, housing, transportation, economic development, natural resources, and public services.

By integrating input from residents, stakeholders, and local leaders, a comprehensive plan provides a cohesive framework that guides decision-making and policy development, ensuring that the town evolves in a way that reflects the shared values and aspirations of its community.

The Comprehensive Plan is an aspirational and community-driven visioning document. Staff, commissions, and elected officials are encouraged to utilize the comprehensive plan to align working efforts and investments with community-engagement driven priorities. However, the Comprehensive Plan is not code or legally binding. It is better thought of as a guide and a source of strategies that boards, commissions, and departments may consider to achieve certain goals.

## Plan Vision

Nederland is a small, friendly mountain town, defined by its hardy locals and a vibrant sense of community. Visitors experience a welcoming and authentic atmosphere where history blends seamlessly with the energy of a well-maintained and economically diverse modern town. As a role model for small-town sustainability, Nederland's residents honor and steward their unique mountain ecosystem, while fostering the resilience needed to thrive in a dynamic environment. In Nederland, neighbors support neighbors, and the town offers jobs, housing, and inclusive leadership for all residents in the Peak-to-Peak region, ensuring a future where everyone can thrive.
