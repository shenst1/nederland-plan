# Existing Conditions & Key Issues

## Water Resources

The Town of Nederland draws its water supply from Middle Boulder Creek and treats it at a facility adjacent to Nederland Middle-High School. The intake location sits on Arapahoe Ranch, across the street from the high school and the treatment plant. The town's source watershed sits on National Forest System lands and is at risk of upstream wildfire impacts. In the event of a fire, the water intake location has a small holding pond that can hold about 1-2 days' worth of water. However, if Middle Boulder Creek was ever contaminated by wildfire debris or other contaminants, the town may not be able to draw water from the creek and the pond could deplete rapidly.

Barring a wildfire or other contaminating event, the water supply is relatively secure in Nederland, with rights and an augmentation plan allowing the town to draw raw water year-round from Middle Boulder Creek. The town also owns 100-acre feet of conditional water rights for an unbuilt "Nederland Reservoir" on Middle Boulder Creek. These rights must be reviewed every six years in Water Court for a finding of reasonable diligence in building such infrastructure. The conditional right allows the town to pursue storage of additional water at or upstream of the treatment plant intake. Finally, Nederland has an agreement with the City of Boulder to store up to 39.6 acre-feet of its senior water right in Barker Reservoir, downstream from the town and the wastewater treatment plant. The town is currently negotiating with the City of Boulder to extend the agreement beyond the 2026 expiration.

The town completed the Colorado "Growing Water Smart" self-assessment, which found that the existing water supply and demand are balanced and projected to remain balanced over the next 25 years with current rates of growth. The current usage is 157.8 acre-feet/year and is projected to rise to 224 acre-feet/year by 2030. Per capita, the current usage is 97-111 gallons/day, which is within, but slightly above, the range of normal water per capita water usage in the US of 80-100 gallons per day, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Water Stats.

Current water efficiency measures in Nederland include water metering, rate structuring, and the town water conservation program (13-71 in town Code). However, the town currently partners with Partner for A Clean Environment (PACE), which provides rebates and incentives to consumers for water conservation, such as water-efficient appliances and outdoor irrigation evaluations.

Finally, new developments in Nederland are currently required to demonstrate physical and legal water adequacy and availability during the final development approval process. Development standards in Nederland are sensitive to water quality protection by limiting urban sprawl, requiring stream setbacks, requiring vegetation and soil erosion protections, imposing stormwater management standards, and promoting density.

## Utilities

The Town of Nederland provides water and wastewater management services on the municipal level. Electricity is provided by Excel and internet service is provided by private companies, including Nedernet, a local service provider.

### Water and Sewer

In 2011, Nederland invested in a state-of-the-art water treatment facility designed to meet the current and near-future needs of the community. The facility was built to accommodate the town's projected growth, but capacity limitations are already being considered as the community expands. The town carefully monitors water demand and the facility is below its firm capacity of .2 MG, which is the facility's maximum water production if one of the two filtration units is out of service. The Town expects to go beyond this firm capacity sometime in the next 10 years. If development and population growth cause the wastewater system to exceed 80% capacity, Nederland will be legally required to start planning for system expansions. Once the system reaches 90% capacity, the town will need to begin to construct expanded water infrastructure to accommodate the increased demand. However, if current growth patterns continue the wastewater plant is projected to stay below the 80% planning threshold for the next 10 years, unless unexpectedly large development/redevelopment occurs.

### Broadband Internet

In 2024, Nederland took a significant step forward in improving its broadband infrastructure by securing a Capital Project Fund grant of $8,667,692 from the Colorado Broadband Office. This funding, in collaboration with Maverix Broadband, Inc., will extend high-speed fiber optic internet service to 2,725 previously unserved or underserved addresses in Nederland, Gilpin County, and parts of unincorporated Boulder County. This project aims to address the digital divide, providing reliable, high-speed internet access to households and businesses that have struggled with connectivity in the past. Expanded internet access is expected to support economic growth, improve access to telehealth, and enhance the overall quality of life for residents.

### Recycling and Composting

During community engagement, residents identified recycling and composting as the second highest sustainability/resilience priority, second only to water resilience. Nederland residents currently have service options for waste removal, recycling, and composting, which can all be dropped off for a small fee at the Nederland Transfer Station and Recycling Drop-off. The Transfer Station is operated by Boulder County and materials left there are eventually brought to landfills and compost/recycling centers elsewhere in the county. There are also private pick-up services residents can pay for to avoid transporting their waste to the Transfer Station. While service options for all waste types exist, residents must take responsibility for engaging in recycling and composting in the home and understand what can and cannot be recycled or composted.

### Renewable Energy Goals

The Utilities Department at the Town of Nederland has identified aspirational renewable energy goals for town fleets and utilities. Over time, the Town would like to transition to an all-electric fleet for town-owned vehicles as well as move towards the use of renewable energy in utility service production and delivery.
