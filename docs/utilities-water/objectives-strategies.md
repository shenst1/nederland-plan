# Objectives & Strategies

## Objective 1: Strengthen the Resilience of the Water System and Protect Existing Water Rights

The Town of Nederland will take proactive measures to protect its water system from potential disruptions, particularly in response to risks such as wildfires near water intake locations. A feasibility study for "Nederland Reservoir" is already complete and could be further pursued to help Nederland secure water rights and expand its water storage capacity. The town should continue securing extensions for existing water storage agreements with the City of Boulder for Barker Reservoir. Nederland will also aim to enhance its water conservation programs, promoting efficiency measures such as rebates for water-efficient appliances and landscaping. The town has not implemented but could consider the following water conservation measures in the future: cash for grass/turf replacement, rebates for water-efficient fixtures and appliances, water-efficient product giveaways, water-efficient building code requirements, conservation education for consumers, landscaping education for property owners and landscaping professionals, water efficiency rebates, or water audits. Additionally, the town will continue to monitor and secure its legal water rights to ensure a sustainable supply for future growth and changing environmental conditions.

## Objective 2: Provide High-Quality Public Utility Services to All Nederland Residents

Nederland will ensure that public utilities, including water, sewer, and electricity, are delivered efficiently and equitably to all residents. The town will assess the need for water system expansion as growth occurs, taking steps to address capacity requirements when thresholds are reached. Coordination with private utility providers should be prioritized through an annual meeting to align infrastructure projects and reduce disruptions. Nederland will also explore opportunities to regionalize utility services in underserved areas, ensuring that all parts of the community have access to essential utilities.

## Objective 3: Continue Progressing Towards Comprehensive Recycling and Composting Programs, Aiming for a Cradle-to-Cradle Zero-Waste System

Nederland will continue taking steps towards its zero-waste management system goals by enhancing existing recycling and composting efforts. In collaboration with Boulder County and local organizations, the town could explore partnerships to manage composting infrastructure, ensuring the right mix of organic materials is collected and processed. Public outreach programs will encourage waste reduction in homes, schools, and businesses while addressing cross-contamination issues. The town will also continue to support local recycling initiatives and consider policies to reduce overall waste generated by public and private entities.

## Objective 4: Promote the Transition to Renewable Energy Sources and Electric Fleets for the Town

Nederland will begin to take steps towards its renewable energy goals by investing in solar and wind energy projects and converting town-owned vehicle fleets to electric vehicles. The town will seek grant funding and partnerships to accelerate the deployment of renewable energy infrastructure and ensure that public buildings and facilities are powered by clean energy. Additionally, Nederland will work with residents and businesses to promote energy efficiency upgrades and renewable energy installations, aiming for long-term reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels.

## Strategies

### Strategy 1: Implement Water System Resilience Improvements

Assess the vulnerability of the current water system to wildfire and natural disasters. Use this information to identify specific actions and improvements that would increase emergency storage capacity options. Develop and implement infrastructure improvements to protect Nederland's water intake system from wildfire-related debris and other upstream hazards (constructing barriers, upgrading filtration systems, backup water storage, etc.). Help secure long-term water storage by developing a new reservoir on Middle Boulder Creek to secure Nederland's conditional water storage rights.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 1

### Strategy 2: Monitor Water Rights and Legal Compliance

Regularly review and update water rights agreements and ensure compliance with the augmentation plan to maintain water security. Continue negotiations with the City of Boulder to extend the storage agreement for Nederland's senior water rights in Barker Reservoir. The current Barker Meadow Reservoir agreement with the City of Boulder expires in 2026.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 1

### Strategy 3: Expand Water Conservation Programs

Implement water conservation measures such as efficient appliance rebates, cash for grass/turf replacement, landscaping education, water efficiency rebates, and community education. Promote the adoption of water-efficient practices throughout the town.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 1

### Strategy 4: Annual Utility Coordination Meetings

Establish annual meetings between the town and private utility providers to align infrastructure projects, reduce disruptions, notify of projects that may impact the availability of services, and ensure efficient service delivery. Look for opportunities to coordinate on upcoming projects to promote a 'dig once' approach to project completion that achieves multiple goals with minimal construction.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 2

### Strategy 5: Regional Utility Service Feasibility Study

Explore the feasibility of extending water and sewer services to underserved areas within Nederland, including costs, funding sources, and potential partnership opportunities.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 2

### Strategy 6: Maintain Impact Fees for New Developments

Ensure that new development contributes to the cost of providing utilities by implementing and maintaining impact fees and other financial tools. Consider the impact of new development on utility systems including factors like population generated, public service costs, and projected revenue from the project.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 2

### Strategy 7: Improve Utility Service Lines

Inspect water mains, service lines, and interior water lines to make sure they are well-maintained, properly installed, and insulated to reduce winter water line bleeding.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 2

### Strategy 8: Partner with Boulder County for Composting

Explore partnerships with Boulder County and regional agencies to develop a composting program, including options for contracting with private composting facilities.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 3

### Strategy 9: Engage the Community in Waste Reduction

Organize community-wide programs to promote waste reduction and participation in recycling and composting efforts, including partnerships with local businesses and organizations. Implement strategies to reduce contamination in recycling and compost streams, including community education, monitoring programs, and penalties for improper waste disposal.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 3

### Strategy 10: Electric Fleet Transition Strategy

Create a strategy to replace town-owned vehicles with electric alternatives, focusing on securing grants for fleet replacement and developing charging infrastructure.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 4

### Strategy 11: Community Renewable Energy Incentive Program

Offer incentives or educate on available rebates to residents and businesses to encourage the adoption of renewable energy technologies, such as solar panel installations, energy-efficient appliances, and electric vehicle charging stations.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 4

### Strategy 12: Engage with Utility Providers for Renewable Integration

Work with Excel Energy to expand the integration of renewable energy into the local grid, including community solar projects and energy storage solutions.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 4
