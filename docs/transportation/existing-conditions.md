# Existing Conditions & Key Issues

Nederland is seeing increased traffic to and through town, and increased demand on roadway and parking infrastructure; however, few significant transportation system improvements have been made over the last decade. Downtown Nederland has limited and narrow sidewalks and limited pedestrian crossings. Transit access in Nederland is regionally focused and infrequent, primarily connecting people to communities and destinations adjacent to and around Nederland, rather than within the town. Additionally, parking is not intuitive and challenging to navigate. The north and south ends of Nederland are connected by a single two-lane bridge over Middle Boulder Creek, posing a challenge in the case of a flood or emergency evacuation. There are no traffic lights in the town; instead, there is a roundabout in the center of town that connects Highway 119, 2nd Street, and North Bridge Street. There are three roads that provide access into and out of Nederland— (1) Highway 119/Peak to Peak Highway, (2) Highway 119/Boulder Canyon, and (3) Highway 72/Peak to Peak Highway. Limited access into and out of town provides challenges during a potential evacuation or peak demand days.

## Roadway Network

The Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) collects annual average daily traffic (AADT) data at eight different locations within the Nederland town boundary. The highest AADT counts are in the center of the Town, with 6,400 average vehicles per day as the highest count. The posted speed limit throughout most of the local roadways in Nederland is 15 miles per hour (mph) and goes up to 35 mph on small segments of roadway. The posted speed limit for the sections of Highway 119 within the majority of town is 25 mph. South of Eldora Road, the posted speed limit of Highway 119 is 35 mph.

## Bicycle and Pedestrian Network

Throughout town, there are limited pedestrian facilities and no dedicated on-street bicycle facilities. Most of the sidewalks in town are concentrated in the central downtown area and are a mix of primarily concrete or gravel. The sidewalks that are composed of gravel and other non-concrete materials do not meet the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) standards for accessibility. In addition to sidewalks, Nederland has a network of both formal and informal trails. Informal trails are generally unmarked desire lines that have been created by pedestrians. There are two formal trails that connect to the sidewalks in the downtown area as well as a cluster of trails in the northwest region of town.

There are a total of 14 marked crosswalks, mostly concentrated in the downtown area; most crosswalks have associated signage, and all crossings are uncontrolled (i.e. there are no flashing beacons or signals located at crossing locations). The paint of many of these crosswalks is faded due to the snow, plows, heavy vehicle traffic, and wear and tear over time.

## Transit Services

The Town of Nederland is currently serviced by three fixed-route transit options and four paratransit services. The fixed route services are the NB route operated by RTD, the Hessie Shuttle operated by Boulder County, and Mountain Rides operated by Peak-to-Peak Transportation. The connection between the NB route and Hessie Shuttle allows travelers from Boulder to travel to the Hessie trailhead with just one transfer. While these transit services connect travelers regionally, there is no local transit service exclusive to Nederland. In addition to fixed-route service, the four different paratransit services available in Nederland are RTD's Access-a-Ride, RTD's Access-on-Demand, Via Mobility, and IntelliRide.

## Parking

Parking utilization data was collected by Fehr & Peers on Tuesday, September 26, 2023, from 7:00am-8:00am, and Sunday, October 1, 2023, from 11:00am-1:00pm at several downtown locations. Parking occupancy, or utilization, is defined as the number of parked vehicles divided by the total supply of parking spaces. Parking occupancy around 85% is generally considered to be industry best practice as the threshold for whether parking is at capacity.

During the weekday morning data collection period, most businesses in Nederland were not yet open and most residents were assumed to be in their homes. It is assumed that this period reflects the time of the lowest parking demand for the study area. Most parking locations observed were less than 20% utilized—therefore it is easy to find parking and there is not a parking supply problem during low demand times.

Weekend parking utilization data was collected during the Nederland Farmer's Market, the Harvest Festival, and peak Fall leaf-peeping season. Due to the multiple events and Fall season, this date was chosen to reflect a peak activity and visitation period in Nederland, when parking demand is at one of its highest points. Almost all the parking locations observed were above 85% utilization, and in some cases, over 100% utilization. This means that it can be challenging to find parking and parking management strategies should be identified. Parking utilization over 100% indicates illegal parking activity. Lack of clear parking signage denoting parking locations likely contributed to illegal parking activity.

## Safety

Fehr & Peers conducted a crash analysis using DiExSys Road Safety Analytics data from January 1, 2018-December 31, 2022. Non-state-highway and non-intersection crashes were not included in the analysis due to potential inaccuracies in the spatial location of crash data.

Most of the crashes analyzed are concentrated in the central downtown area of Nederland at the roundabout and at the intersection of Eldora Road and Highway 119. There are also individual crashes that occur at curvatures on the road along Highway 119. 68% of crashes resulted in property damage only (i.e. non-injury crashes). From the five years of crash data analyzed, there was only one fatal crash due to a head-on collision between a truck and a motorcycle navigating a curve on Highway 72. From 2018-2022, there was one crash involving a person walking at the roundabout and one crash involving a person bicycling.

The most common type of crash during the study period were fixed-object crashes including parked motor vehicle crashes, which contribute to 30% of all crashes. The second most common types of crashes were broadside, overturning, and rear end crashes, each representing 14% of crashes. The least common types of crashes were head on, overtaking turn, bicycle, and pedestrian crashes, each representing 3% of crashes. These crash locations and crash patterns were used to inform recommendations.

## Engagement Summary

Several areas for improvement along the transportation network were identified during the public and stakeholder engagement process. Common themes expressed were expanding bicycling and pedestrian infrastructure, improving transit access, and enhancing roadway comfort and maintenance.

### What Was Heard

**Bicycling and Pedestrian Infrastructure**

Nederland residents, employees, and visitors expressed a desire to improve walking and rolling infrastructure in Nederland. Desired improvements include improving pedestrian crossings (especially at the roundabout and Visitors Center), repairing and filling gaps in the sidewalk network (especially along Highway 119), installing additional pedestrian amenities, improving snow removal on sidewalks, and installing pedestrian-scale lighting in the downtown area. The community also expressed an interest in improving trail access and allowing for accessible connections to trails, securing bicycle parking, and implementing a bike share program.

The community expressed support for a second pedestrian bridge through town that would be open to vehicles for emergency use only. There was continued concern about winter maintenance of pedestrian infrastructure, which will need to be prioritized in the future.

**Transit**

The Nederland community expressed interest in expanded transit service, including increased frequency, extended service hours, and additional transit routes within the town and the region. Community members were also interested in improving ease of riding transit by making real-time information on transit routes and schedules more readily accessible, and by improving bus stops with shade, trash cans, and benches.

In response to proposed recommendations, Nederland residents supported increased NB frequency, particularly around peak commuting hours and on the weekends. There was also support for bus stop improvements and for providing support for elderly and disabled riders. The community expressed continued interest in a bus service to Eldora Ski Resort for Nederland locals.

**Roadways**

The biggest concerns that Nederland residents expressed regarding roadways were maintenance and parking. There was significant concern about winter roadway maintenance, especially the degradation of painted street lines. Residents also expressed a desire for better parking management, and potentially additional parking locations, especially downtown. The community was also interested in improvements to the roundabout in town, and potentially the construction of additional roundabouts.

The community expressed support for the proposed road improvements. There was widespread support for geometric modifications and striping and signing enhancements at the intersection of Highway 119/Lakeview Drive to slow speeds, improve pedestrian safety, and reduce queuing for drivers. There was emphasis on the need for a turn lane at this location. Community members also supported similar enhancements at Eldora Road/Highway 119. Community members were generally in favor of parking management strategies, including paid parking, signage formalizing parking, and loading zones.
