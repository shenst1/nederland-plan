# Objectives & Strategies

## Objective 1: Prioritize Transportation Equity and Safety

As a popular destination for visitors and a growing population, Nederland's transportation system serves people of all ages, backgrounds, and abilities. As a result, the transportation system must be comfortable and accessible for all users. The town will prioritize equity by providing support and signage for non-English speakers, complying with ADA accessibility requirements throughout transit and pedestrian facilities, and providing transportation options for users of all ages and abilities. Additionally, the town will prioritize comfort by managing vehicle speeds, implementing safety improvements at intersections with a crash history, protecting pedestrians and bicyclists with dedicated crossings and facilities, and strategically utilizing programs and policies to prioritize people walking, biking, and taking transit.

## Objective 2: Ensure that Walking is Comfortable and Accessible

By ensuring that it is comfortable and accessible for people walking, Nederland will be able to reduce traffic impacts and carbon emissions. The town will promote pedestrian comfort and accessibility by upgrading the existing sidewalk network and expanding the sidewalk and trail network near key destinations. Formalizing select existing informal trails will allow residents to walk between key destinations comfortably and efficiently. The town will also ensure pedestrian comfort by upgrading existing pedestrian crossings and adding additional crossing locations. Upgrades include a pedestrian signal, roadway narrowing, and colored concrete at crossing locations.

## Objective 3: Increase Regional Transit Options

Nederland will increase the mobility of its residents and decrease car congestion by working with RTD to improve regional transit options. These improvements will allow Nederland residents to travel more easily within their community and access the Eldora Ski Resort more quickly and will help to manage visitor traffic. Improvements include expanded rural regional transit, expanded transit to Boulder, expanded transit to Eldora, and new intra-Nederland transit during peak demand days.

## Objective 4: Maintain Transportation Infrastructure

Nederland will proactively and consistently maintain its transportation infrastructure to ensure comfortable road conditions into the future. To do this, the town will need to consider additional funding sources for additional equipment and staffing as well as create a pavement and street sweeping plan. This increased investment in and improvements to maintenance will allow Nederland to prolong the lifespan of its transportation infrastructure and allow for comfortable travel for years to come.

## Objective 5: Implement Parking Management Strategies

Nederland will consider and implement parking demand management strategies. Short-term recommendations are aimed at addressing potential future challenges in the next five years and are focused on parking demand management strategies that shift parking demand rather than adding parking supply. Long-term strategies will be determined based on the effectiveness of short-term strategies but may include expansion of parking supply.

## Strategies

### Strategy 1: Sidewalk and Trail Improvements

Upgrade existing sidewalks and trails and implement new sidewalks and trails per the map in the Transportation Plan. This strategy will create a complete and connected pedestrian network that will provide access to key destinations and serve as recreation for people of all ages and abilities.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objectives 1 and 2

### Strategy 2: Enhanced Pedestrian Crossings

Upgrade existing pedestrian crossings with signals and surface materials and add new pedestrian crossings where appropriate. Pedestrian signals should be considered at the Visitors Center and library to improve pedestrian safety and reduce vehicle delay. Denote all striped crosswalks on Highway 119 with colored concrete rather than striping. Lastly, implement new pedestrian crossings at Highway 119/Navajo Trail, West 2nd Street/North Jefferson Avenue, Highway 119/East Street, and Highway 119/East 3rd Street.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objectives 1 and 2

### Strategy 3: Roadway Enhancements at Intersections

Implement improvements at the three intersection locations identified in the Transportation Plan: the roundabout, Lakeview Drive/Highway 119, and Eldora Road/Highway 119. Upgrade the existing roundabout to meet CDOT standards to effectively divert vehicle traffic to slow speeds and improve pedestrian crossings. At Lakeview Drive/Highway 119, implement turn lanes and receiving lanes. Lastly, at Eldora Road/Highway 119, implement turn lanes and receiving lanes in the short-term and a roundabout in the long-term.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objectives 1 and 2

### Strategy 4: Traffic Calming Measures

Operating speed data and community concerns both confirm high vehicle speeds in town. These high speeds are reported on local roadways as well as state highways. In the near term, maintain existing striping and implement a more regular restriping program to counteract the impacts of local weather conditions. Maintaining centerline, edge, and crosswalk pavement markings can reduce speeds. In the long term, visually narrowing the roadway through centerline and shoulder striping and painted bulb outs on local roads can significantly lower traffic speeds.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objectives 1 and 2

### Strategy 5: Transportation Programs

Programs related to transportation help expand transportation options for travelers. Implement programs including: curbside management to allow for 15-minute pick-up/drop-off locations, wayfinding as identified in the DDA Wayfinding Plan that includes key destinations and travel distances, and Transportation Demand Management strategies such as educational resources and pedestrian amenities.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objectives 1 and 2

### Strategy 6: Boulder County Safety Study

Implement projects recommended in the upcoming Boulder County Safety Study to address safety concerns based on crash patterns and the high-risk network.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 1

### Strategy 7: Bus Stop Upgrades

Upgrade all bus stops to include an ADA landing pad, adjacent sidewalks, nearby crosswalks, trash cans, and motion-censored pedestrian-scale lighting. Where feasible, bus stops should include paved bus pullouts to reduce delay to traffic, bike parking, wayfinding signage, benches, a shelter, and route information. These amenities will make the transit experience more comfortable for all users.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 3

### Strategy 8: Regional Transit Expansion

Work with regional partners to expand transit service between Nederland and neighboring jurisdictions. This includes coordination with Boulder County on the planned mountain driver program, educational resources about available public transportation and paratransit options, and increased coverage and frequency of transit to Boulder, Ward, and Rollinsville.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 3

### Strategy 9: Intra-Nederland Circulation

Continue to collaborate with existing regional shuttles, such as the shuttle to the Hessie Trailhead, that provides additional connections to the town. Through collaborative efforts, Nederland can leverage shared costs and resources to provide transit within the town. A circulator should also be considered on peak demand days that provides convenient access to parking lots and other key destinations within town.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 3

### Strategy 10: Updated Maintenance Plan

The proposed enhanced roadway, bicycle, and pedestrian infrastructure as recommended in this plan will require increased investment in maintenance. To support this new infrastructure, consider creating a pavement and street sweeping plan, in addition to the town's existing snow plowing plan, to maintain walking/rolling, biking, and driving as reliable transportation options year-round. The snow plowing plan should be reevaluated with an eye to prioritizing maintenance of pedestrian facilities and access to transit.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 4

### Strategy 11: Parking Demand Management Strategies (Short-term)

Implement parking demand strategies including expansion of paid parking, expansion and greater enforcement of time-restricted parking, expansion of shared parking, improvement of wayfinding around parking lots, and data collection and monitoring of parking supply during peak demand days/times.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 5

### Strategy 12: Expansion of Parking Supply (Long-term)

Continue to monitor parking demand in the future following the implementation of short-term parking demand management strategies, as identified in this chapter. If data shows a growth in parking demand, causing parking to begin to reach capacity even with the short-term recommendations in place, the town may want to consider expanding parking supply. The decision to add capacity should not be based entirely on demand but should also be a value-based decision among the community.

**Relevant Objectives:** Objective 5
