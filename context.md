## We are Nederland

The Town of Nederland is a unique and special place that residents proudly call home. Over time, this
historic mining town has evolved into a thriving modern-day mountain community filled with people
who love its historic and rustic character, breathtaking mountain scenery, proximity to outdoor
recreation, and natural serenity. The purpose of this document is to chart a visionary path forward for
the Town of Nederland, ensuring future growth and development aligns the community with its values.
But before the community can fully know where to go, it is important to reflect on where the Town of
Nederland has been.

```

## About Nederland

```
TOWN HISTORY
Nederland’s history is one of tenacity and transformation, from its early days as a seasonal gathering
place for the Ute and Arapahoe tribes to the ebbs and flows of its mining booms. Each chapter of its
past weaves a story of a community that thrives against the odds, reinventing itself with every challenge.
```
```
In the centuries before European settlers arrived, the Ute and Arapahoe tribes called this glacial valley
home, drawn by its rich natural resources and tranquil beauty. They came seasonally to hunt, forage,
and raise their animals, leaving a legacy of respect for the land that remains woven into Nederland’s
identity. Today, Chipeta Park honors this heritage, named for Chipeta, the wife of Chief Ouray of the
Tabeguache Ute tribe.
```
```
The mid-19th century brought waves of European settlers, initially drawn to the fur trade. The valley,
with its flat terrain and dependable water sources, soon became a modest settlement. Originally called
“Dayton,” then “Brownsfield,” the community’s name changed to “Nederland” in the 1870s, when a
Dutch company purchased the Caribou Mine, one of the region’s richest sources of silver. “Nederland,”
meaning “lowland” in Dutch, symbolized both the geography of the valley and the European ties of its
investors.
```
```
The mining boom of the late 19th century transformed Nederland into a bustling hub, bringing hundreds
of hopeful miners and entrepreneurs. By 1916, the town reached its peak population of 3,000 during the
tungsten boom, a surge sparked by discoveries of the rare mineral near the town. Tungsten, a critical
material for industrial and wartime uses, brought wealth and vitality to Nederland. But, like the silver
rush before it, this boom was short-lived. By 1920, the tungsten market collapsed, and the population
dwindled to just a few hundred.
```
```
In the decades that followed, Nederland’s identity began to shift. Wealthy Front Range families acquired
abandoned mining cabins, repurposing them as summer retreats. The 1940s brought a brief resurgence
of tungsten mining during World War II, but the town’s mining legacy faded as the war ended.
```
```
By the 1960s, a new kind of energy infused the valley. Nederland became a refuge for free-spirited
individuals drawn to its rugged beauty and open-minded community. The arrival of the “hippie”
movement, with its emphasis on creativity and environmental consciousness, planted seeds of the town’s
artsy, independent character. Around the same time, the opening of Eldora Mountain Resort brought
winter tourism to the area, further cementing Nederland’s reputation as a haven for those seeking
recreation and renewal in the mountains.
```
```
In the years since, Nederland has continued to evolve, blending its rich history with a forward-looking,
community-driven ethos. The revitalization of downtown in the 1990s and a growing emphasis on
tourism have supported the local economy while preserving the small-town charm that residents and
visitors cherish. Each chapter of Nederland’s story reveals a town that adapts, thrives, and never loses
sight of the unique spirit that makes it home.
```
**4 Comprehensive Plan** 2024 **Update**


**NEDERLAND TODAY**

Nederland today is a small town (population 1,471) with a vast spirit. It has a distinctive character
defined by its artsy, quirky atmosphere and strong ties to the surrounding natural environment.

The town’s economy is diverse, supported by industries such as professional services, education, and
construction. Many residents commute to larger cities like Boulder and Denver for work, while a
significant portion—over 40%—work remotely, taking advantage of Nederland’s scenic setting and
peaceful atmosphere. Local businesses cater to both residents and tourists, offering services and
amenities that reflect the unique character of the community.

Housing in Nederland is primarily made up of older, single-family homes, with a median construction
date of 1973. While these homes contribute to the town’s historic and rustic aesthetic, the high median
home price of $800,000 poses challenges for affordability, particularly for renters. Limited housing
availability and increasing costs underscore the importance of pursuing creative and thoughtful solutions
that ensure Nederland remains a welcoming and accessible place that families can stay in for generations
and newcomers seeking rugged mountain living can find community.

Tourism plays a significant role in Nederland’s economy, with the town serving as a gateway to outdoor
recreation in the surrounding mountains. Eldora Mountain Resort, located a short drive away, is a
major draw for visitors, especially during the winter months, when alpine and Nordic skiing are popular
activities. The town also attracts visitors year-round with its scenic beauty and proximity to trails, open
spaces, and natural areas.

As Nederland grows in popularity, it continues to navigate the challenges of balancing the needs of its
residents with those of visitors and a growing remote workforce. By addressing the challenges of the
day, like climate change, rising home prices, and changes to downtown, Nederland can maintain its small-
town appeal and remain a historic, artistic, resilient, and tight-knit mountain community.

Nederland has an aging population. Residents of Nederland generally desire to age in place even as
the town wrestles with how to welcome new families and remain an accessible place to live. This
demographic trend is common in many of Colorado’s mountain communities, which are becoming
less affordable, to the general effect of excluding younger and lower-income individuals and adversely
impacting older adults that want to age in place but may not be able to afford to downsize, or find a new
home that more appropriately meets their current needs as a result of the high cost of housing and the
costs associated with changing homes
```
```
These demographic trends have several implications for long-range planning. The Town should prepare
to serve an aging population and focus on accessibility projects that can ensure Nederland’s older
residents still have excellent access to services, recreation, and a high quality of life. At the same time,
the Town may want to retain and attract families and younger community members. The Town of
Nederland is already beginning to suffer the consequences of losing youth and workers. As populations
age and become wealthier it can be hard to find employees for essential services and professions,
resulting in shortages of service workers, public staff, and teachers. Children and families who grew up
in Nederland may be forced to leave if costs are too high. Increasing the ability for new families with
different backgrounds to move to Nederland is an important consideration to strengthen the resilience
of the town’s economy and sense of community.
```
**6 Comprehensive Plan** 2024 **Update**


**REGIONAL CONTEXT**

Nederland is an integral part of the Peak-to-Peak Highway corridor, a scenic byway that connects
mountain communities from Estes Park in the north to Central City and I-70 in the south. This highway
not only highlights the region’s stunning natural beauty but also plays a key role in fostering connections
among small towns like Ward, Rollinsville, and Gold Hill. Residents from these smaller communities
often rely on Nederland for essential services, groceries, and gathering spaces, reinforcing the town’s
role as a central hub in the area.

Located just about a 26-minute drive from Boulder, Nederland is close enough to access the broader
amenities and services of the Front Range while maintaining its distinct rural mountain character. The
town also serves as a gateway for all ski traffic to Eldora Mountain Resort, which sees an average annual
visitation of 271,000 according to its master plan. This positioning brings significant quality of life benefits
to residents of Nederland, but also brings steady seasonal activity to Nederland, especially in winter
when skiers and snowboarders pass through on their way to the slopes.

The region’s climate and geography set it apart from the nearby plains, with colder winters and a
rugged mountain culture that shapes both daily life and the local economy. Despite its small population,
Nederland plays an outsized role in the surrounding region, offering a mix of services and community
events that draw both residents and visitors alike. Its strategic location and unique character ensure that
Nederland remains a key node in Boulder County and the broader mountain corridor.

## About This Plan

```
THE ROLE OF A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN
A comprehensive plan is a document that guides land use policy, future growth, development,
and preservation for a community over several years. The community planning process involves a
combination of public engagement and analysis and is designed to draw out public priorities such
as land use, housing, transportation, economic development, natural resources, and public services.
By integrating input from residents, stakeholders, and local leaders, a comprehensive plan provides
a cohesive framework that guides decision-making and policy development, ensuring that the town
evolves in a way that reflects the shared values and aspirations of its community. The plan document
represents the final phase of the planning process,
after which the municipality may implement
the recommendations of the plan and use the
plan as a policy guide for the years to come. It
is important to recognize the comprehensive
plan’s role as an aspirational and community-
driven visioning document. Staff, commissions,
and elected officials are encouraged to utilize the
comprehensive plan to align working efforts and
investments with community-engagement driven
priorities. However, the Comprehensive Plan is
not code or legally binding. It is better thought of
us a guide and a source of strategies that boards,
commissions, and departments may consider to
achieve certain goals.
```
```
PLANNING PROCESS
To update the comprehensive plan, the planning
team conducted a robust existing conditions
assessment that included a review of existing
policies, land use and zoning, transportation
and connectivity, economic development,
housing, natural resources, hazard exposure, and
infrastructure. The planning team also conducted
focus groups with key stakeholders for each
plan chapter as well as a robust community
engagement process designed to understand the community’s vision and top priorities for the town.
```
```
The planning process incorporated a parallel in-depth design and land use analysis of downtown
Nederland, culminating in the Downtown Subarea Plan. The Downtown Subarea Plan is a standalone
vision and policy document, but part of this comprehensive plan process. It is referenced several times in
this document and goes into more depth on issues specific to Downtown.
```
## Legal

## Foundation

```
A comprehensive plan is described in
the Colorado State Statutes Section
31-23-206 as an “advisory document to
guide land development decisions.” The
statute provides that “it is the duty of the
[planning] commission to make and adopt
a master plan for the physical development
of the municipality, including any areas
outside its boundaries, subject to the
approval of the governmental body having
jurisdiction thereof [Board of Trustees].”
Following the adoption of the community
plan or comprehensive plan, it is the task
of the Board of Trustees to update zoning
and other local policies to align with the
adopted community plan.
```
**8 Comprehensive Plan** 2024 **Update**


**COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT**

The engagement process for the comprehensive plan update involved two primary opportunities for
community input: a Visioning Open House and an online survey. The Open House, held on January
23rd at the Nederland Community Center, brought together approximately 40 attendees. Participants
interacted with 12 themed poster boards covering key topics such as parks, recreation, sustainability,
housing, and economic development, offering feedback through stickers, write-ins, and multiple-choice
questions. This in-person event facilitated direct conversations between community members, town
staff, and the planning team.

To complement the Open House, an online survey was launched the same day and remained open until
March 5th, gathering 205 responses. The survey mirrored the Open House questions, allowing residents
who couldn’t attend or preferred a slower-paced environment to share their thoughts. Together, these
engagement efforts provide valuable insights into the community’s vision and priorities for the next
decade. Insights from the open house and survey helped this plan prioritize policies and formulate vision
statements to drive each topic area.

**PLAN VISION**

Each chapter starts with a topic area vision statement that articulates the goals of the Town for that
topic and is the core driver behind the policies within. This vision statement is the over-arching town
vision that weaves the topic area vision statements from each chapter together into one comprehensive
statement about the future and direction of Nederland.

```
Nederland is a small, friendly mountain town, defined by its hardy locals
and a vibrant sense of community. Visitors experience a welcoming and
authentic atmosphere where history blends seamlessly with the energy of
a well-maintained and economically diverse modern town. As a role model
for small-town sustainability, Nederland’s residents honor and steward their
unique mountain ecosystem, while fostering the resilience needed to thrive
in a dynamic environment. In Nederland, neighbors support neighbors, and
the town offers jobs, housing, and inclusive leadership for all residents in the
Peak-to-Peak region, ensuring a future where everyone can thrive.
```
```

```
PLAN STRUCTURE
The Nederland comprehensive plan is structured
around seven main topic area chapters. Within
each chapter is an “existing conditions and key
issues” section, which is a point-in-time summary
of related information and issues for each topic
theme. These sections provide valuable baseline
information about each topic and contribute to the
policy direction. The policy section of each chapter
is titled “Objectives and Strategies.” These sections
are broken into objectives (overarching goals and
a general approach to achieving the goals) and
strategies (more specific policy and programmatic
recommendations that the town may consider).
Strategies are not legally binding but are potential
actions that may be implemented as boards,
commissions, and town staff identify priorities, and
develop work/investment plans that align with staff
and fiscal capacity.
```
```
This comprehensive plan is also driven by the guiding framework of resilience. The City Resilience Index^1
is a way of applying the concept of resilience to urban planning and is utilized to align each objective of
this plan with a sub-topic within resilience. For more information about the resilience framework please
read the “Plan Framework: Resilience” section below. It is important to note that each objective in this
comprehensive plan is tagged with one of the following four resilience themes throughout. Look for the
following icons throughout the plan document to reference each of these resilience themes.

## Plan Framework: Resilience

**DEFINING RESILIENCE**

Community resilience describes the capacity of places to function so that the people living and working
in them can survive and thrive no matter what stresses or shocks they encounter. Coming from the
field of ecology in the 1970s, resilience refers to the ability of complex systems to maintain equilibrium
or recover quickly from shocks and other unforeseen circumstances. The concept of ‘resilience’ can
also apply to a community such as Nederland because the town is a complex system that must adapt
to changing circumstances and unexpected stressors. This adaptation must be done while maintaining
social cohesion and community identity, sound decision-making and governance, physical infrastructure,
a robust economy, and a healthy environment.

“Resilience” serves as a high-level core value for this plan. It is the driver behind the more specific goals,
policies, and actions in this plan, and a guidepost to orient key community decisions about growth,
development, investment, and prioritization.

**WHY RESILIENCE?**

Resilience is a highly relevant framework to guide decision-making in Nederland because it aligns
with existing community values and can help address pressing concerns the town faces now and in
the near future. It is a framework that meets the demands of the current moment. Over the next
decade, exposure to natural hazards and uncertainty due to climate change will undoubtedly increase.
When community members were asked what sustainability initiatives were a top priority for them,
they identified mitigating wildfire risk and protecting water supply as two of the top concerns. These
results highlight the widespread community concern for increasing hazard risk and environmental
unpredictability.

In conversations with community members, leaders, and stakeholders, the values of sustainability, living
in harmony with nature, and being self-reliant and hardy were raised in almost every conversation.
The reality of living in an alpine environment means community members in Nederland recognize
the challenges of the climate and environment they are a part of, and because of that have a strong
awareness and respect for the area’s natural environment.

In the context of climate change, the concept of resilience helps bridge the gap between sustainability
policies such as carbon emission reduction and land conservation, and hazard risk reduction initiatives
like wildfire preparedness and mitigation. Both concepts, sustainability and hazard preparedness, are
central to Nederland’s trajectory and fit under the umbrella of ‘resilience.’ Going beyond environmental
topics, resilience encompasses other key planning topics in this plan such as transportation, city services,
infrastructure, quality governance, local economy, health and social services, community culture, and
housing development. Each of these topics contributes to a strong community that is socially and
physically flexible, resourceful, inclusive, and integrated. This makes resilience a powerful way to frame
the future of Nederland both for this plan and for future key decisions as they arise.

```
Introduction 11
```

```
DRIVING POLICY WITH THE CITY RESILIENCE INDEX
The City Resilience Index is a theoretical framework that helps apply the concept of resilience to urban
growth and development. It was developed by sustainable development experts at the consulting firm,
ARUP, and funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. At the highest level, the CRI breaks the concept
of resilience into 4 dimensions. For this comprehensive plan, these 4 dimensions offer a practical
way of framing the proposed goals, actions, and policies herein. In this plan, each proposed policy is
categorized by one or more of these dimensions of resilience, which helps show how each contributes
to Nederland’s resilient future.
```
```
The four dimensions of resilience are listed and described in Figure 1.2.
```
## THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

## SUSTAINABILITY AND RESILIENCE Land Use

```
The last comprehensive plan in Nederland was organized around the core value of sustainability.
As it pertains to urban development, sustainability is often defined as, “development that meets
the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their
own needs.” Sustainability refers to the responsible consumption of resources and mitigating
environmental harm through policies like reducing emissions, protecting lands, or recycling waste.
```
```
Sustainability is a necessary component of resilience. An unsustainable city cannot be resilient,
because it will eventually deplete itself of its necessary resources and contribute to the conditions
that exacerbate climate change or any other number of self-harming dynamics. In this sense,
sustainability is a value that falls under the broader concept of resilience.
```
```
Sustainability is an important component of this plan and is one of the highest values expressed by
Nederland community members. Nederland will continue to uphold sustainability as a core value
and should consider it as an inherent part of the resilience framework. The shift from sustainability
to resilience reflects an evolution in environmental thinking, focusing not only on responsibly
consuming and protecting resources but also on considering a community’s adaptability and ability
to live in harmony with nature. While the definition of resilience is different from sustainability,
resilience implies and requires sustainability.

# 2 Land Use

**14 Comprehensive Plan** 2024 **Update**


This chapter lays the foundation for the vision, goals, and policies that will direct Nederland’s future
growth, development, and community character. The concepts in this chapter were developed through
conversations with stakeholders about the needs of the community, an analysis of existing land uses,
regulations, and market conditions, and public input on the priorities of the town and the desired
character of the community. This chapter includes policy recommendations to improve land use
outcomes, the 3-mile plan, and the Future Land Use Map (FLUM). These policies and plans are intended
to move Nederland towards sustainable growth and development, promote the development of more
affordable housing, and protect the rustic and eclectic mountain town character of Nederland.

## Existing Conditions & Key Issues

**ZONING AND LAND USE**

Zoning and land use are fundamental concepts in urban planning, though they refer to different aspects
of land management. **Zoning** is the legal framework that dictates what can be built on a parcel of land,
including the types of buildings and their uses, whereas **land use** describes the actual, on-the-ground use
of land at a given time. In most cases, land use aligns with the zoning designation, but discrepancies can
occur. Historic communities, like Nederland, developed before zoning laws often have higher rates of
non-conforming uses.

To avoid confusion in this document, the names of zoning districts are capitalized, such as “General
Commercial” or “Medium-Density Residential,” while land uses are referred to in lowercase, such as
“commercial” or “medium-density residential.”

**_CURRENT ZONING_**

Nederland’s zoning regulations encompass nine standard zoning districts, which are categorized into
residential, commercial, industrial, and public zones. These districts are shown in Table 2 and the zoning
map (Figure 2.2). Understanding how land is zoned versus how it is currently used provides a crucial
snapshot of the town’s regulatory landscape and highlights areas where adjustments may be necessary.

CURRENT LAND USE
The existing land use in Nederland is categorized into eleven standard types, as shown in Table 3 and
the existing land use map (Figure 2.4). This analysis reveals that nearly 27.4% of the land in Nederland is
undeveloped, while low-density residential use occupies nearly half of the town’s area. Parks and public
land comprise 14.6% of land areas while other land uses, such as commercial, industrial, and public/civic,
make up smaller percentages.

**KEY ISSUES & CONCEPTS**

```
UNDEVELOPED LAND AND THE RELATIONSHIP TO INFILL
DEVELOPMENT
27.4% of Nederland’s land area is classified as undeveloped (public or private), highlighting some
potential for infill development. However, not all vacant parcels are buildable due to environmental
factors or regulatory barriers like minimum lot sizes.
```
```
Most of the undeveloped parcels are located in the Public, Mountain Residential, or High-Density
Residential zones. Some of these parcels represent an opportunity for new development to occur
without expanding into surrounding areas, especially if zoning regulations like minimum lot sizes are
reduced to make them buildable. Whenever possible, infill development is preferable because it is fiscally
and environmentally sustainable, increasing the value and economic output of existing land without
requiring significant new infrastructure investment.
```
```
RESIDENTIAL ZONING DENSITIES
Nederland’s four residential zones collectively account for 65% of the town’s land area. These zones
establish residential neighborhoods and give the town four residential character designations with
varying levels of intensity. For example, the Mountain Residential zone regulates neighborhoods with
the largest lot sizes and lowest density while the High-Density Residential zone regulates neighborhoods
with the smallest lot sizes and highest potential for density.
```
```
Despite having distinct High Density and Medium Density Residential zoning districts, actual high-density
and medium-density residential buildings (those with 9+ or 2-8 units, respectively) make up only 0.6%
of all land area in Nederland. While in the past single-family housing development was promoted and
prioritized, the recent Housing Needs Assessment has highlighted the need to make room for multi-
family development as well. The current lack of medium and high-density residential housing is a missed
opportunity to increase the town’s total housing supply, especially since multi-unit housing is generally
more affordable and can house workers.
```
```
Existing regulations in these zones make it challenging to permit multi-unit housing. For example, any
building with more than 4 units must go through a special review or planned unit development (PUD)
process. Furthermore, minimum lot sizes and minimum parking requirements render many of the
parcels where multi-unit housing is theoretically allowed unbuildable in practice.
```
```
LAND USE & INDUSTRIAL OPPORTUNITIES AT WOLF TONGUE
The Wolf Tongue industrial zone is currently underutilized as an industrial zone. It is largely occupied by
legally non-conforming residential uses, with only one parcel being used for industrial activities. While
these residential uses are not seen as inappropriate for the character of the area, there is an opportunity
to leverage Wolf Tongue more for light industrial uses that could support the local economy, such as
a maker’s space or auto mechanic shop. The ongoing discussion about the future of this area, currently
identified as “Downtown Flex” in the Future Land Use Map (FLUM, Figure 2.7), presents an opportunity
to rethink how this site contributes to a diversified and resilient local economy.
```
**20 Comprehensive Plan** 2024 **Update**


**_THE NEED FOR MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING_**

Nederland faces a significant need for more affordable housing. The 2023 Housing Needs Assessment
(HNA) highlights that the town’s housing costs have risen sharply, with a median home price of
$800,000 and a significant portion of renters being cost-burdened. The need for affordable housing and
the town’s strategy to address these problems are addressed heavily in the following housing chapter.
As a desired land use outcome, it is essential for land use regulations to support more affordable
housing developments by adopting affordable housing-friendly permitting procedures. The town should
also revisit any zoning regulations that add unnecessary friction to affordable housing development such
as minimum lot size and minimum parking requirements.

**_THE DESIRE FOR URBAN GROWTH MANAGEMENT
AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT_**

There is a community desire to manage growth in a way that prioritizes sustainability and limits
expansion into natural habitat. Affordable housing and social services stakeholders identified benefits to
encouraging denser development downtown, such as the ability to support more services, live within
walking distance of key services, and provide better transportation options to residents.

Until December 2022, Nederland was involved in an intergovernmental agreement (IGA) with Boulder
County that limited its ability to annex additional territory without the approval of the county. This
agreement aimed to preserve Nederland’s distinct character, prevent unplanned urban expansion,
and maintain the rural nature of the surrounding lands. Despite its expiration, there hasn’t been much
progress on negotiating a new IGA since 2022. While the town now has more flexibility to grow, it also
needs to be careful not to expand beyond its service limits or fiscal capacity. Infill development within
the existing town boundaries offers a more sustainable alternative to outward expansion, allowing
Nederland to accommodate growth while preserving surrounding natural landscapes and limiting the
expansion of infrastructure and services.

**_YARD AND BULK STANDARDS_**

Some yard and bulk requirements in Nederland may be working against housing affordability and
sustainability goals. The minimum lot sizes in the code are relatively large. The current large minimum
lot sizes in the lowest-density residential districts may have adverse impacts on the realization of the
community’s goals. Namely, large lot sizes increase the cost of development due to the high costs of
larger parcels of land, thereby decreasing affordability. Neighborhoods with the largest minimum lot
sizes (Mountain Residential and Low-Density Residential zones, for example) correlate with Nederland’s
most expensive and largest single-family homes. Low-density, large lot development tends to produce
a less efficient land use pattern in which the cost of providing public infrastructure often exceeds the
municipal revenue (in the form of property taxes) generated by these large lot homes. The large lot sizes
also render some lots in town unbuildable, reducing opportunities for infill or affordable housing. This
pattern of land use further promotes growth into surrounding undeveloped lands, degrading community
values of sustainability and conservation for ecological and scenic purposes.

As an example of the issues caused by large lot size minimums, in the Mountain Residential (MR) zone,
the minimum lot size is 1 acre. However, there are several existing developments in that zone on lots
smaller than an acre. Arguably, these legally non-conforming uses pose no real misalignment with the
zone’s intent, indicating that the regulation may be overly restrictive. The same is true in the Low-
Density Residential zone where the minimum lot size is 16,000 square feet. Below are two examples
of legally non-conforming developments that would not be permitted without a variance under today’s
minimum lot size requirements.

PRESERVING MOUNTAIN TOWN CHARACTER
As part of the Downtown Subarea planning process, Open House attendees and respondents to the
online survey were asked a series of questions about architecture, the character of Nederland, and what
makes Nederland have a ‘unique sense of place.’ Overwhelmingly, results pointed towards the value of
preserving mountain town character. Words like “rustic”, “local”, “community”, “walkable”, “historic”,
“vibrant”, “funky”, “natural setting”, and “creek access” were used to describe what people love about
Downtown.
```
```
At the Open House, attendees were also asked to vote for architectural development styles they would
like to see downtown (see Figure 2.5). The most popular architectural attributes included hardened
materials, balconies, no more than two stories, smaller buildings, rustic aesthetic, local art, creek access,
and references to mining history.
```
## Lot Size Minimums

99 King Pl. was built in 1981 on a 12,200
square foot lot and could not be permitted in
the Low-density Residential zone today
without variance.

```
**22 Comprehensive Plan** 2024 **Update**


**_CURRENT DEVELOPMENT PROCESS_**
Nederland’s current development process channels a disproportionately high number of projects
through a Planned Unit Development (PUD) process, which is administratively costly and time-
consuming for both the town and developers. The PUD process is appropriate for projects that require
multiple variances or that are non-conforming to the underlying zoning code. However, the current
scope of the PUD regulations is too broad, even requiring standard developments to undergo this
complex process. Revising these regulations to streamline permitting for conforming developments
could encourage growth while maintaining appropriate oversight for more complex projects.

**CONCLUSION**

These existing conditions and key issues provide a foundation for the objectives and strategies that will
guide Nederland’s future land use decisions. By understanding the current landscape of land use and
contemporary planning challenges, the town can guide decisions that balance growth, sustainability,
and the preservation of its unique character. The following section will outline specific objectives and
strategies designed to address these key issues and help Nederland achieve its long-term vision.

**LAND USE VISION STATEMENT**

```
Nederland’s land use regulations help achieve sustainable development
goals, affordable and sufficient housing, and maintain historic mountain
town character. Land use regulations support business and residential
needs. The zoning code is consistent, easy to interpret, and supports the
next increment of growth and development needed to strengthen the local
economy and house new workers and families.
```
**OBJECTIVES & STRATEGIES**

```
OBJECTIVE 1:
Direct New Growth to Appropriate Locations and Encourage Sustainable Infill
Development
```
```
As Nederland continues to grow at a modest rate, it is essential to manage this growth by
directing development to appropriate locations and ensuring it occurs at a scale that balances growth
and sustainability. In other words, new development should not outpace the Town’s ability to provide
services or recuperate costs for new infrastructure maintenance. New development can be positive,
offering opportunities for Nederland to attract businesses, accommodate new residents, increase the tax
base, and fund vital infrastructure and services. However, unmanaged growth can lead to uncontrolled
expansion into sensitive landscapes or introduce developments that disrupt the character of existing
neighborhoods, posing environmental and fiscal risks.
```
```
To mitigate these potential harms, Nederland should focus on directing greenfield development
to specific, suitable areas identified in the 3-Mile Plan (Figure 2.6) and implement an urban growth
management strategy to discourage expansion outside these areas. Regarding infill development and
adaptive reuse, the town will support property owners in incrementally expanding and redeveloping
their properties. This approach to growth increases the value and utility of existing land, enhances
community prosperity, and avoids the need for extensive new infrastructure investment, making it both
fiscally and environmentally sustainable. Infill development will be guided by land use regulations that
ensure new projects fit within the character of existing neighborhoods, preserving the town’s unique
identity and natural scenery while allowing for gradual, sustainable growth.
```
```
OBJECTIVE 2:
Promote the Development of More Affordable Housing with Supportive Land
Use Regulation
```
```
To address housing affordability and meet the Housing Needs Assessment (HNA)
recommendations, Nederland will evaluate and consider revising land use regulations to eliminate
barriers to housing development. This could include reducing restrictive yard and bulk requirements,
easing minimum parking requirements, and streamlining the permitting process for multi-family and
affordable housing projects. Making these changes could help the town facilitate the construction of
smaller homes, diverse housing types, and affordable housing complexes, ultimately ensuring that housing
needs are met in a timely and cost-effective manner.
```
**24 Comprehensive Plan** 2024 **Update**


OBJECTIVE 3:
**Preserve the Historic Mountain Town Character of Downtown Nederland**

Nederland values the historic quality of its downtown and the eclectic, rustic mountain
town feel of the entire community. To preserve these qualities, the town may consider
evaluating development proposals against architectural design requirements and form-based zoning
standards, particularly within the downtown subarea. Future development proposals will be evaluated
for consistency with established character areas from the Downtown Subarea Plan, with a focus on
preserving views, limiting building heights to 35 feet, and encouraging the adaptive reuse of historic
buildings. Community input will be sought to ensure that preservation efforts reflect the values
and aspirations of residents. More information about this recommendation can be found within the
Downtown Subarea Plan.

OBJECTIVE 4:
**Support Key Business Uses in Appropriate Locations for a Strong and Flexible
Local Economy**

To foster a strong and adaptable local economy, Nederland will promote the development
of high-quality, flexible commercial spaces that meet the needs of key business sectors such as childcare,
healthcare, and other essential services. The town will work to reduce regulatory barriers for these
businesses, particularly in underutilized areas like the industrial Wolf Tongue Area, which will be
promoted for flexible commercial use. By supporting diverse business opportunities, Nederland aims to
enhance economic resilience and provide essential services to the community.

OBJECTIVE 5:
**Clarify and Simplify Code and Land Use Designations**

Nederland is committed to making its land use regulations clear, accessible, and easy to
interpret for all residents. Simplified and transparent permitting processes will empower
property owners to engage in local development, contributing to the town’s prosperity and strong
community foundation. The town will reserve the Planned Unit Development (PUD) process for
complex projects requiring multiple variances while ensuring that the comprehensive plan provides a
streamlined, objective framework for evaluating development proposals.

OBJECTIVE 6:
**Mitigate Hazard Exposure and Risk Through Land Use Regulation**

Nederland will use land use regulations to minimize exposure to environmental hazards
and protect both property owners and the broader community. The town will continue to
prohibit development within the FEMA-designated 100-year floodplain and will discourage development
in areas with elevated wildfire exposure which may be determined by referencing the Colorado State
Forest Service Wildfire Risk Map. Proactive planning measures, such as encouraging defensible space
and home hardening through education and regulation, will be employed to mitigate wildfire risk. By
integrating hazard mitigation into land use planning, Nederland can enhance community resilience and
safeguard its natural and built environments.

**26 Comprehensive Plan** 2024 **Update**


**STRATEGIES**

1. Evaluate and Adjust Minimum Lot Size Requirements: Explore the potential for reducing minimum
    lot size requirements across all residential zones to promote the development of smaller housing
    units that enhance Nederland’s housing diversity while maintaining the character of existing
    neighborhoods. Consider halving the minimum lot sizes in the Mountain Residential and Low-
    Density Residential zones to unlock new development opportunities. In the Mountain Residential
    zone, the current minimum lot size is 1 acre which could be reduced to 0.5 acres, meanwhile,
    the minimum lot size in the Low Density Residential zone is 16,000 sq ft, which could be reduced
    to 8,000 sq ft. This adjustment could make previously undeveloped, undersized lots viable for
    development and allow for the subdivision of larger lots into multiple parcels that can be developed,
    thereby increasing the town’s overall housing stock.
2. Revise Off-Street Parking Requirements: Explore reducing off-street parking minimums for multi-
    unit residential developments in the Commercial, High-Density Residential, and Medium-Density
    Residential zones to facilitate easier multi-unit development. Consider updating the current
    requirement of one off-street parking spot per bedroom with a more flexible standard, as outlined
    in the proposed table (Table 5). This new approach would still mandate a baseline of off-street
    parking for new developments while allowing any additional parking needs to be met through
    optional developer-provided spaces.
3. Simplify Permitting for Multi-Unit Residential Developments: Amend the code to eliminate the
    requirement for residential developments with four or more units to undergo a Planned Unit
    Development (PUD) process. Instead, establish a streamlined permitting pathway for multi-family
    development proposals, allowing them to follow a standard approval process, thereby reducing
    complexity and encouraging the development of additional housing units.
4. Implement Strategy 2: “Accessory Dwelling Units” from the Housing Chapter: Amend the code
    to permit more than one accessory dwelling unit (ADU) per property, provided that the property
    continues to meet all applicable yard and bulk standards. For more information, reference the
    corresponding strategy in the Housing chapter.
5. Designate Affordable Housing as a By-Right Use: Update the zoning code’s use table to classify
    affordable housing as an allowed use by right in all residential zone districts, ensuring that affordable
    housing projects can proceed without the need for special approvals or conditional use permits.
    Strategy 1, in the Housing chapter provides recommendations for further defining affordable
    housing.
6. Explore Inclusionary Zoning: Investigate the feasibility of implementing inclusionary zoning, a strategy
    that requires or encourages developers to dedicate a percentage (typically 10-20%) of units in new
    residential developments to affordable housing. Recognized as a recommended approach by DOLA
    under HB1271 for increasing affordable housing supply (see Strategy 6: “Implement additional
    qualifying 1271 Strategies” of the housing Chapter), this policy requires careful consideration. Prior
    to adoption, the town should conduct a thorough impact and feasibility analysis to assess potential

```
effects, including the risk of discouraging development due to increased project costs.
Key considerations for implementation include evaluating available incentives and grant opportunities
for developers, studying best practices from other municipalities, and analyzing the strength of the
local real estate and development market.
```
7. Explore Strategy 3: “Density Bonus” from the Housing Chapter: Consider implementing a density
    bonus program that would allow developers to build additional units or gain an extra floor beyond
    the existing height limits in exchange for providing a specified number of affordable housing units.
    For more information, reference the corresponding strategy in the housing chapter.
8. Develop a booklet of pre-approved residential designs: Create a booklet of pre-approved
    architectural designs and styles for missing middle housing typologies, including duplexes,
    townhomes, and small apartment buildings, to streamline the development review process and
    ensure new housing fits seamlessly into existing neighborhoods.
9. Implement the First Street Overlay Zone: Enact the First Street Overlay as recommended in the
    Downtown Subarea Plan to enhance architectural control over future developments along First
    Street. This overlay will introduce specific form and bulk standards to ensure that new proposals
    align with the desired character of the area.
10. Encourage the protection of historic assets: As described in depth in the Downtown Sub-aera
    Plan, promote the preservation of historic assets within the town by actively encouraging property
    owners to explore preservation opportunities, utilize available tax credit incentives, and consider
    establishing historic districts for significant areas downtown.
11. Promote adaptive reuse and activation of vacant buildings and sites: Encourage the revitalization of
    vacant and underutilized properties by making adaptive reuse more feasible for property owners and
    developers. Strategies may include expedited permitting, façade improvement grants, use variances,
    and land banking. Additionally, consider implementing a vacant property registration, tax penalties
    for long-term vacancies, and a blighted property ordinance to incentivize timely redevelopment.
    These efforts aim to activate downtown spaces and align redevelopment with the town’s vision.
12. Designate in-home childcare as a by-right use: Amend the use table to allow in-home childcare as
    a by-right use in all residential zones, eliminating the need for a special review permit. This change
    responds to the community’s clear need for local childcare services and supports residents in
    opening in-home childcare centers more easily. By simplifying the regulatory process, the town can
    better address childcare demands while ensuring that safety and qualification standards are met
    through other appropriate regulations.

13. Promote the renovation of commercial buildings for enhanced business use: Encourage the
    renovation of aging commercial buildings to create higher-quality spaces suitable for advanced
    commercial activities, such as healthcare offices and other professional services. This initiative aims
    to elevate the standard of commercial properties in the town, attracting higher-order businesses and
    contributing to the economic vitality of the community.
14. Evaluate and redefine the industrial zone: Conduct a comprehensive review of the existing industrial
    zone, where a significant portion is currently used for residential purposes. The town should explore
    two potential pathways: rezone the area to allow for a mix of residential, commercial, and industrial
    uses, or revise the definition and permitted uses within the industrial zoning category to better align
    with the current and future needs of the site. This process will require detailed analysis and input
    from the Planning Commission to ensure that the revised zoning reflects the community’s vision and
    accommodates appropriate uses, such as maker spaces or other commercial-industrial activities, that
    can coexist with residential development.
15. Revise PUD requirements and streamline permitting pathways: Conduct a comprehensive review
    and revision of the Planned Unit Development (PUD) regulations to ensure that only projects
    requiring multiple variances or those that are non-conforming to the underlying land use code
    are routed through the PUD process. Simplify and clarify permitting pathways for conforming
    developments to reduce administrative burdens on town staff and developers, allowing for more
    efficient and predictable project approvals. This approach will maintain appropriate oversight for
    complex developments while ensuring that routine projects can proceed without unnecessary delays
    or added costs.
16. Ensure development consistency with the comprehensive plan: Implement a project consistency
    evaluation rubric as a tool to objectively assess whether development proposals align with the goals
    and objectives outlined in the comprehensive plan. This rubric or step-by-step process will provide
    clear guidance for evaluating proposals, ensuring that all developments contribute positively to the
    town’s long-term vision and strategic priorities. Adding a statement of consistency to the Nederland
    Municipal Code will help codify consistency between the comprehensive plan and municipal code.
17. Implement Strategy 4: “Expedited Development Review Process“ from the Housing Chapter:
    Simplify development review processes for affordable housing projects. Please reference the
    corresponding strategy in the Housing chapter for more information.
18. Implement Strategy 5: “Decrease Development Review Fees, Impact Fees, and Associated
    Development Fees” from the Housing Chapter: Reduce the financial barriers associated with
    development review for affordable housing projects. Please reference the corresponding strategy in
    the Housing chapter for more information.
19. Evaluate Land Use Regulations for Alignment with Wildland Urban Interface Code Best Practices:
    Evaluate how existing land use regulations could be amended to better align with land use best
    practices in fire-prone areas. Consider updating building codes or development standards to require
    fire-resistant building materials and construction. Provide guidance on using fire-resistant materials
    and construction techniques, including non-combustible roof assemblies, eaves, vents, gutters,
    exterior walls, windows, and surface coverings to improve the resilience of homes and buildings.
    Consider requiring vegetation management as a site development standard including actions such as
    tree thinning, spacing, limbing, and trimming; removal of any vegetation growing under tree canopies
    (typical-ly referred to as “ladder fuels”), surface vegetation removal, and brush clearance; vegetation
    conversion, fuel modifications, and landscaping.

## 3-MILE PLAN

```
The three-mile plan shows a three-mile radius surrounding the Town of Nederland. Per the Colorado
Revised Statutes 31-12-105(e), municipalities are required to conduct long-range planning for growth
and annexation within three miles of their boundary.
```
```
Nederland’s three-mile future land use map (Figure 2.6) shows public lands such as US Forest Service
Lands and County Open Space. These land classifications restrict Nederland’s ability to grow in these
areas. The map also shows private lands that are eligible to be annexed. Areas that could be considered
for annexation/future growth were identified by members of the planning commission and are outlined
in black.
```
```
ANNEXATION CONSIDERATIONS
Annexation offers both opportunities and challenges for Nederland as it plans for future growth. As a
positive, annexation can give the town greater control over land use in surrounding areas, allowing for
more strategic and cohesive development that aligns with the town’s vision and goals. It can also expand
the tax base, bringing in additional revenue that can be used to support infrastructure, services, and
amenities for residents. Moreover, annexing adjacent lands could create opportunities for expanding
housing options, commercial spaces, and public facilities, helping to address some of the town’s current
challenges, such as housing affordability and economic diversification. Additionally, increasing the number
of citizens within town boundaries could allow for greater participation on town boards and other
official participation opportunities that folks living outside of town boundaries are currently excluded
from.
```
```
However, annexation also comes with potential downsides. Expanding the town’s boundaries can
strain existing infrastructure and public services, requiring significant investments in utilities, roads, and
emergency services to accommodate the new areas. There is also the risk of disrupting the natural
landscapes and rural character that surrounds Nederland, which could be at odds with the community’s
desire to preserve its unique mountain town feel. Additionally, annexation may lead to increased
development pressure and challenges in maintaining the balance between growth and environmental
sustainability. These factors must be carefully weighed as the town considers potential annexations
within the 3-mile radius, ensuring that any expansion aligns with long-term goals for sustainable and
controlled growth.
```

FIGURE 2.6

**THREE-MILE FUTURE LAND USE MAP**


## Land Use

```
The Future Land Use Map (FLUM) is a critical component of Nederland’s comprehensive plan, serving as
a visual guide for the town’s long-term development strategy. The FLUM reflects the community’s vision
for growth, land use, and preservation, and it provides a framework for making informed decisions about
where and how future development should occur. It is a tool that helps translate the goals, objectives,
and strategies outlined in this plan into actionable spatial policies, ensuring that growth is directed to
appropriate locations while protecting the town’s character and natural environment.
```
```
The FLUM identifies areas for residential, commercial, industrial, and public uses, as well as areas
for mixed-use development and open space. The FLUM itself is not a zoning map and does not hold
regulatory power. However, by delineating these areas, the FLUM helps to guide zoning decisions, inform
infrastructure planning, and ensure that future development is compatible with the town’s overall vision.
```
```
Town officials, planners, developers, and community members will use the FLUM as a reference point
when evaluating development proposals, rezoning requests, and other land use decisions. It provides a
clear visual representation of where different types of development are encouraged, where conservation
is prioritized, and how various land uses should relate to one another. By aligning future growth with the
patterns established in the FLUM, Nederland can ensure that its development is strategic, sustainable, and
in harmony with the community’s values.
```
```
The following future land use categories are used in the FLUM and defined below:
```
```
Downtown Core Mixed Use – this area follows the currently zoned CBD area. A mix of uses is desired
in this area, and it should continue to function as the walkable downtown core. Commercial uses on the
ground floors of buildings with residential, offices, or lodging above are appropriate.
General Commercial – these areas are appropriate for larger-format commercial buildings (as exists
today) though mixed use is allowed and should be encouraged as well.
Neighborhood Mixed Use – this area follows the currently zoned NC area. These properties should
remain residential in character, but a mix of light commercial and residential use is appropriate.
Downtown Residential – these areas are appropriate for, and mainly function today as, multifamily
residential, minus the church property. Residential continues to be supported in these areas as an
appropriate use.
Flex – this area includes the Wolf Tongue Mill area. This is the only industrial-zoned land in Nederland
today. While industry was the former use of the area, it is not anticipated that industrial uses will grow
or are appropriate in downtown. Allowing this area to be more flexible in use, including residential,
commercial, and light industrial is more appropriate.
Neighborhood Residential – these areas are the core residential zones in Nederland and are appropriate
for a variety of housing typologies including single-family homes, duplexes, townhomes, cottage courts,
and small apartment buildings. Non-residential uses like churches, schools, daycare, and public spaces are
also appropriate.
Mountain Residential – these areas are peripheral residential zones in Nederland with single-family
homes built on larger lots. These zones typically have difficult topography and are tucked further into
mountainous terrain, making them more or less appropriate for more intense residential development.
Parks & Open Space – these areas should be maintained as land for the public to enjoy. As stated
previously, this includes the potential to acquire the triangular lot (Amerigas Lot) for public use.
Public – these areas are public uses today (Town Hall, parking lots, Mining Museum, Library, town
facilities, etc.) and should be maintained as such uses in the future.

## Introduction

This chapter lays the foundation for the vision, goals, and policies that will direct Nederland’s future as it
relates to housing. This chapter describes current housing conditions and future housing needs as well as
opportunities to increase the supply of housing to meet the needs of current and future residents. The
concepts in this chapter were developed through conversations with stakeholders about the needs of
the community, an analysis of current market conditions, the 2023 Town of Nederland Housing Needs
Assessment, and public input on the priorities of the town and desired character of the community.
The recommended strategies identified in this chapter are informed by research on national and state
best practices with sensitivity towards a small town, rural context. The recommendations that follow
are considered alongside the Town of Nederland’s goals for sustainable growth, development of more
affordable housing, and preserving the rustic and eclectic mountain town.

## Existing Conditions & Key Issues

**SETTING THE CONTEXT**

Population growth has remained steady from 2000-2022 throughout the State of Colorado, growing
from 4.2 million people to 5.8 million people, with an average annual growth rate of 1.5%, nearly double
the US national rate of 0.8%.^1 From 2008-2018, the construction of new housing units did not keep
pace with population growth due to the impacts of the Great Recession on the housing market. In
recent history, housing units have developed at a much higher rate, with the State of Colorado adding
an estimated 180,000 housing units between 2018 and 2022 while the state population increased by
161,000 over the same time.^2 While the rate of housing production is trending upwards, the hiatus of
housing development between 2008-2018 left most of the State with an undersupply of housing relative
to the increase in demand for new homes.

In addition to an undersupply of current housing stock around the State, there are several socio-
economic factors outside the purview of government that affect the housing market. For example, the
COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the global supply chain and drove up the cost of construction materials
and inflation following the COVID-19 pandemic has driven up interest rates. Mountain communities
already struggle with higher costs of construction materials and a lower availability of construction
workers under normal market conditions and the cost of building new homes in rural mountain
communities can often face added challenges such as environmental concerns, topographic constraints,
and land availability. Meanwhile, since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, mountain
communities across the American West have seen an influx of remote workers from more expensive
cities who are choosing to relocate to mountain communities for increased access to recreation and
outdoor amenities, and a desire for more small town living, which is driving up housing prices more
rapidly than any other region in the United States.^3

These larger sociological and demographic changes, coupled with Nederland’s charming town character
and setting as a mountain community nestled in the foothills of Boulder County in the Denver
Metropolitan area have placed new challenges on the town such as rising median home prices, an influx
of high-income earners skewing the area median income calculations in Nederland, and a demand for a
diverse range of housing options that meet the needs of current and future residents.

## KEY ISSUES AND OPPORTUNITIES

```
CURRENT HOUSING STOCK
The 2023 Housing Needs Assessment highlighted the lack of diversity in housing type and insufficient
available housing in the Town of Nederland. As of 2020, there were 720 housing units, of which 679, or
94%, are single unit detached homes. In 2020, 63% of current housing units were for-sale units whereas
37% were rental units. From 2020-2022, the Town of Nederland added roughly 44 housing units (6%
increase). The US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) maintains a State of Cities
Database (SOCDS) which tracks permitting trends around the Country. According to SOCDS data, the
housing that was permitted in the Town of Nederland from 2012-2018 consisted primarily of single-unit
housing with an average of roughly 6.5 units permitted year-over-year. Starting in 2019, the town has
seen an increase in multi-unit residential developments. The Tungsten Village Boulder County Housing
Authority affordable housing development was completed in 2020 and is adding needed multifamily
affordable housing units to the town’s housing stock. From 2019-2022, there has been an increase in
the permitting of market rate two-unit multi-family residential units as seen in Figure 3.1: Housing Unit
Building Permits.

The 2023 Town of Nederland Housing Needs Assessment calls for the town to continue to increase
the diversity of the housing stock by allowing for a greater range of “missing middle housing” to
meet housing affordability needs and general housing supply needs. The Housing Needs Assessment
explains that given the current cost of building, the residential density “sweet spot” to entice affordable
housing development is 18-20+ rental units per acre of land or 15+ ownership units per acre across
Colorado. This range of units is often viewed as too dense for the Town of Nederland and may not be
an appropriate target based on the town’s existing development pattern and community preferences;
however, this density range is recognized as the most cost-effective range of units to build to justify
multifamily development. Increasing residential density decreases per-unit costs, making affordable
housing development more financially feasible. This goal of continuing to diversify the housing stock does
not need to happen all at once and can be managed on an ongoing basis.

**36 Comprehensive Plan** 2024 **Update**


The land use chapter of this comprehensive plan outlines how the town’s zoning code and land use
regulations could be amended to better accommodate a diversity in housing types in the future.
Nederland should aim for a manageable increase in new multifamily units in a 3–5-year time frame so
that the community can incrementally work out how to diversify it’s housing stock. An appropriate
short-range target would be to follow the Town of Nederland’s commitment for Proposition 123 which
would mean adding 12 units over 3 years.^5

**_HOUSING RELATIVE TO EMPLOYMENT_**

The Town of Nederland has a residential population of 1,467 people. There are around 763 people
employed in the town, most of whom live outside of Nederland, according to the 2022 American
Community Survey. The area median income (AMI) in Nederland is $101,944 as of 2021. For
comparison, the AMI of Boulder County is $92,466. According to the 2021 Longitudinal Employer-
Household Dynamics (LODES) data from the US Census Bureau, less than 1% of the current residents
are employed in Nederland, and more than a third of the current residents are employed outside of
Nederland (LODES 2017-2021). Considering that less than 1% of the current residents live and work
in Nederland, 34% of the current residents live in Nederland and work elsewhere, and most people
employed in Nederland are commuting from outside of town, local housing prices are not grounded in
the context of the local employment market.

**_AFFORDABILITY_**

The 2023 Nederland Housing Needs Assessment (HNA) highlighted affordability issues as a top concern
for residents in The Town of Nederland, and that the town currently has a shortage of affordable for-
sale and rental housing units. In 2020, the Median Home Price in Nederland was $496,000, just within
the affordable realm for a household making over $120,000. By 2022, the American Community Survey
indicated a median home price of $617,100, a 24.4% increase in two years. The HNA indicates that
current median home values are around $800,000. According to the HNA, “Based on the research
completed for this report, and the current average sale price in Nederland, a household looking to
purchase a home in Nederland would need to expect to spend somewhere around $800,000 and such a
purchase will require at least a $220,000 annual household income (Note: this is a generalized estimate
and does not anticipate shifting interest rates).”

As of 2021 over 23% of the current residents are considered housing cost burdened; this may be
a higher percentage of the population in 2024 as home prices have risen dramatically since 2021.
According to the 2023 town of Nederland Housing Needs Assessment, 82% of homeowners making
under $35,000 (or roughly 30% and under of the AMI) are paying 30% or more of their household
income on housing costs. For households within the 50-80% AMI category, roughly 55% of homeowners
were spending more than 30% of their household income on housing costs.

Finding affordable rent in Nederland is also challenging. The HNA found that 57% of renters with a
household income of $75,000 or greater were cost-burdened by rent. Overall, 47% of households in
Nederland are cost-burdened by housing, with approximately 13% being ‘extremely cost-burdened,’
meaning they pay more than 50% of their gross income towards housing costs.

Vacancy rates are low for rental housing in Nederland. There are affordable apartment complexes in
town such as The Brown Apartments, Beaver Creek Apartments, Tungsten Village, and Prime Haven.
The 6 units at Prime Haven are senior/disability designated. There are also 6 single-family style affordable
units available at Rodeo Drive. The triplexes on West 3rd Street, Smurf Village, and some of the
Kathmandu apartments are also generally affordable but are not officially operated as affordable housing.
At the time of the HNA study in 2023, there were no vacancies available at any of these locations. The
supply of market rate rental units is also relatively low on capacity. Indian Peaks Real Estate owns 19
single-unit houses, two 3-unit properties, and one 4-unit property. They are being rented at market
rate, ranging from $1,150 to $4,000, and at the time of the study, there were only two single-unit rental
properties vacant.
```
```
The Brown Apartments are owned and operated by the Emergency Family Assistance Association
(EFAA), where they offer temporary housing for families and seniors. The program provides intensive
case management for 6-12 weeks before helping tenants transition to more permanent affordable
housing through subsidies and being a liaison to find housing opportunities. A waitlist system is used to
fill units as occupants transition out of The Brown Apartments.
```
```
Beaver Creek Apartments and Tungsten Village receive subsidies through the Boulder County Housing
Authority and federal HOME funds, and together these properties offer 38 affordable units for low to
moderate-income households. Tungsten Village rent amounts are generally $575 to $1,100 less per
month than comparable market-rate units. Tungsten Village is primarily funded through federal Low-
Income Housing Tax Credits (LITHC), which are offered to developers and housing authorities to
construct and provide affordable housing to residents at rents that are lower than the market rate,
serving households with income at or below 60% of Area Median Income.

**_FUTURE HOUSING NEED_**

The Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) recently completed a Regional Housing
Needs Assessment which examines the current and future housing needs in the Denver region. This
assessment was conducted independently from the Town of Nederland’s Housing Needs Assessment
and used a different population survey from the Census (ACS 1-year PUMS). The Regional Housing
Needs Assessment identified a need to build 115 new housing units in the Town of Nederland from
2023 to 2032. The Town of Nederland Housing Needs Assessment recommends the target of building
65-150 new rental housing units, and 50-110 new for-sale housing units centered around a phased
approach. The DRCOG Regional Housing Needs assessment further includes an interactive application
that quantifies the housing needs in the region to the submarket level, and jurisdictional level. The
assessment further breaks down the future housing needs by the number of housing units needed at
each AMI level. A breakdown of the number of housing units needed at each AMI level in the Town
of Nederland based on the analysis conducted for the DRCOG Regional Housing Needs Assessment
can be seen in Table 6. The Regional Housing Needs Assessment, and the Town of Nederland Housing
Needs Assessment should both be thought of as tools to aid the Town of Nederland in their long-term
planning for housing need and should not be viewed as mutually exclusive.

**ENGAGEMENT SUMMARY**

The following community input comes from the comprehensive plan open house, and the associated
online survey that was open from January 23 to March 5, 2024. Further, the project team held a
stakeholder meeting with the Peak-to-Peak Housing and Human Services Alliance and their associated
members on February 8th, 2024.

**_WHAT WAS HEARD_**

There was agreement between attendees and respondents that there is a shortage of affordable homes
for lower-income and all-income levels and a lack of long-term rentals available on the market. Most
respondents felt that short-term rentals and seasonal homes contribute to the housing shortage and that
the shortage is negatively affecting local businesses. When asked what other factors may be contributing
to housing issues, the most popular responses were the lack of affordable units, lack of available units,
and rising rents/utility costs.

When asked a series of questions regarding how the town should respond to housing needs, Open
House attendees typically wanted the town to take an active and regulatory stance. Most attendees
disagreed with the statement that the private market should be allowed to address housing on its own.
However, survey respondents were more split on how Nederland should address housing problems.
Overall, the community favored policies like land purchases, tax credits, rent subsidy programs,
investment of municipal dollars, and upzoning. However, respondents were neutral on the idea of
regulating the housing market to prioritize specific types of housing.
```
```
Finally, the community was asked what housing types they would like to see more of in Nederland.
There was a high degree of support for most types, demonstrating a desire for housing diversity. The
most supported types from the Open House were small single-family homes, deed-restricted affordable
housing, accessory dwelling units, cohousing, and senior housing supporting ‘aging in place.’ Survey
respondents showed outsized support for small single-family homes, senior housing, and ADUs. There
was a resounding agreement against developing large single-family homes from the Open House and
survey. Multi-unit typologies like apartments, duplexes, and townhomes all received some support from
the community, but not as strongly as the previously mentioned options.
```
```
The resounding outcome of this exercise is a clear need for affordable housing and a strong community
desire to work on this problem. There was a general emphasis on prioritizing infill to meet housing
needs and balance sustainability goals, and a willingness to explore different housing typologies with local
government taking an active lead in promoting the solution.
```
```
STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK – NEEDS AND OPPORTUNITIES
The top recommendation emerging from stakeholder conversations with Peak-to-Peak Housing and
Human Services Alliance was the desire for a regional housing authority including Nederland and the
entire Peak-to-Peak region, potentially also including Lyons and Idaho Springs. The existing affordable
housing stock in Nederland is operated by either EFAA or the Boulder County Housing Authority
(BCHA). In both cases, these groups serve greater Boulder County. In the case of BCHA, they receive
federal funding so residents who access these affordable housing opportunities could be from anywhere,
not specifically for current residents of Nederland. This dynamic presents a challenge to the region
because they cannot plan their own affordable and workforce housing. For EFAA properties, housing
is limited to applicants with direct ties to Nederland. Because of the inherent differences between the
Peak-to-Peak communities and the Front Range the towns of Nederland, Lyons, Gilpin County, and
Central City are working on a study to assess the feasibility of a multijurisdictional regional housing
authority for the Peak-to-Peak region so that regional housing authority resources and planning are
more locally applicable to these communities.
```
```
A regional housing authority could serve many functions, including reaching out to landlords and
property managers, encouraging them to serve more locals and accept housing vouchers, providing
mortgage assistance to buyers, assisting renters who don’t have the money for a deposit, and organizing
stakeholders in the Peak-to-Peak region around these objectives. Ultimately the authority could
prioritize locals and the workforce housing needs of the region when units become available.
```
```
This group further emphasized the affordability crisis in Nederland, pointing out that even community
roles like teachers, principals, and municipal employees are commuting due to the cost and unavailability
of housing options.

**_HOUSING VISION STATEMENT_**

```
“Housing meets the social, economic, and environmental needs of the
community through sustainable development. We encourage housing that
enhances community by supporting the housing needs of local workers and
residents. New housing positively contributes to, and respects, the character
and style of existing architecture and neighborhoods while allowing residents
of all ages, incomes and abilities the opportunity to live with dignity in our
community”.
```
## Objectives & Strategies

The following objectives and strategies are designed to help the Town of Nederland work toward its
vision for housing. These objectives and strategies are informed by recent planning work, including
community engagement, from The Town of Nederland, along with policies, and programs from the State
of Colorado and Boulder County. Additional recommended strategies in this plan were informed by
housing policy guidance from Local Housing Solutions, a non-profit housing policy platform developed to
inform policy makers and local governments on a set of resources to support local housing strategies.

OBJECTIVE 1:
**Implement Recommendations from the 2023 Housing Needs Assessment**

The 2023 Housing Needs Assessment outlined four key policy strategies. The four strategies
are (1) allow small square footage residential units and smaller square footage lot sizes; (2)
Develop flexibility in land occupancy requirements; (3) Increase town support and clarify procedures
for the development of affordable housing development; (4) Identify opportunities to expedite the
development review process for affordable housing development. The Housing Needs Assessment also
included five recommendations to couple the strategies. Since the Needs Assessment was completed,
the Town of Nederland has since implemented those five recommendations. However, additional
recommendations from the Needs Assessment not yet implemented are outlined as actions 1 – 5 in this
chapter’s actions section.

OBJECTIVE 2:
**Leverage Opportunities from recent State legislation**

House Bill 1271, passed in the Colorado 2021 regular house session, helped fund
Nederland’s Housing Needs Assessment through its local government planning grant
program. In addition to planning grants, this bill creates the local government affordable housing
development incentives grant program. This program allocates grants to qualifying municipalities to
help them promote the development of affordable housing that is driven by community benefits and
that focuses on critical housing needs as identified by the local government. Boulder County received a
capacity grant and Town of Nederland staff are involved in the administration of the grant. Nederland
could still be eligible to go after a capacity grant independent of the Boulder County capacity grant in
the future which could be used to bolster staff bandwidth on issues related to housing by, for example,
helping to fund a Housing Coordinator position. To qualify for a grant, communities must have adopted
three qualifying strategies, at which point they may apply for funds to support an affordable housing
development project directly or through programs that support affordable housing development or
preservation in the long term.

In the 2024 legislative cycle, the State Senate passed SB 24-174 which requires each local government
in the State of Colorado, beginning December 31, 2026, to conduct and publish a housing needs
assessment and submit these needs assessments to the Department of Local Affairs. Further,
communities in Colorado that have a population of 5,000 or greater, or a population of 1,000 or greater
and are considered a rural resort community (Nederland fits this category) to submit a Housing Action
Plan which is considered a separate document from the Housing Needs Assessment and is should be
used to demonstrate a local government’s commitment to address housing needs and that guides a local
government in developing legislative actions, promoting regional coordination, and informing the public
of the local government’s efforts to address housing needs in the local government’s jurisdiction.
```
```
In addition to the requirements outlined above, SB 24-174 further outlines that local governments
will be able to access technical assistance and guidance through a grant program (administered by the
Division of Local Government), the provision of consultant services, or both to aid local governments in:
```
- Establishing regional entities;
- Creating local and regional housing needs assessments;
- Conducting a displacement risk analysis with a state-created tool;
- Identifying and implementing strategies included in the standard affordability strategies directory,
    long-term affordability strategies directory, or displacement risk mitigation strategies directory;
- Making and adopting a housing action plan;
- Enacting laws and policies that encourage the development of a range of housing types, including
    regulated affordable housing, or mitigate the impact of displacement; and
- Creating strategic growth elements in master plans.
The act creates the continuously appropriated housing needs planning technical assistance fund to
contain the money necessary for the division to provide this technical assistance and guidance. The act
requires the state treasurer to transfer $10.5 million from the local government severance tax fund
and $4.5 million from the local government mineral impact fund to this fund. Further, the act directs
the division to serve as a clearing house for the benefit of local governments and regional entities in
accomplishing the goals of the act. The Division of Local Government shall report on the assistance
requested and provided under the act.

```
On and after December 1, 2027, for any grant program conducted by the Department of Local Affairs
(DOLA) , the Colorado Energy Office (CEO), the Office of Economic Development and International
Trade (OEDIT), the Department of Transportation (CDOT), the Department of Natural Resources
(DNR), the Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE), or the Department of Personnel
and Administration that awards grants to local governments for the primary purpose of supporting land
use planning or housing, the act requires the awarding entity to prioritize awarding grants to a local
government that:
```
- Has completed and filed a housing needs assessment;
- Has adopted a housing action plan that has been accepted by the department;
- Has reported progress to the department regarding the adoption of any strategies or changes to
    local laws identified in the housing action plan; and
- Is the subject of a master plan that includes a water supply element and a strategic growth
    element.
In the 2023 State legislative cycle, the Colorado State House passed HB23-1304 (Proposition 123) which
created the State Affordable Housing Fund, which dedicates 40% of funds to an affordable housing fund
that is administered by DOLA and allocates the remaining 60% to the affordable housing financing fund
which is administered by the Office of Economic Development and International Trade (OEDIT). Local
governments can qualify to access funds from either affordable housing funding program by committing
to increase existing affordable housing units by 3% each year and codifying an expedited review process

**42 Comprehensive Plan** 2024 **Update**


for affordable housing developments. The Town of Nederland filed their commitment to Proposition
123 in October of 2023, with a baseline of 138 affordable units, committing them to adding 12 units over
3-years.

OBJECTIVE 3:
**Continue to Build Upon Regional Partnerships**

The Boulder County Housing Authority (BCHA) is the housing authority for all areas of
Boulder County outside the city limits of Longmont and Boulder, including the cities of
Lafayette and Louisville, and the towns of Superior, Nederland, and Erie, and all unincorporated areas
of the county. BCHA’s mission is to foster the availability of quality, affordable housing, and related
housing services for the residents of Boulder County. BCHA also works in partnership with the cities of
Boulder and Longmont to help increase the supply and availability of affordable homes throughout these
communities.

The primary program offerings from BCHA include providing affordable rentals, housing choice
vouchers, rental assistance, personal finance coaching, mobile home support, and family self-sufficiency
education. In the Town of Nederland, BCHA funds and operates Beaver Creek Apartments (12 units
with HOME funding), Tungsten Village (26 Units with LIHTC funds), Rodeo Court (6 single-family
homes), and Prime Haven (6 subsidized units where tenants pay 30% of their income towards rent).
HOME funding refers to the HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME), which is a federal
block grant program administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
LIHTC funds were established by the Tax Reform Act of 2986 and provide tax credits to private
investors in exchange for equity investments in affordable housing projects.

The Boulder County Regional Housing Partnership and its plan established a goal that 12 percent of
rental and ownership housing across the region be permanently affordable for low-, moderate-, and
middle-income households by 2035. This affordability goal is for the region, but many of the jurisdictions
have set the same goal for themselves. The Town of Nederland has participated in this group, although
the Board of Trustees (BOT) has not adopted the goal. It is uncertain whether the current BOT is
aware of the goal established in 2017.

The Town of Nederland, along with neighboring communities in the Peak-to-Peak region which spans
portions of Boulder, Gilpin, and Clear Creek Counties and includes Idaho Springs, Black Hawk, Central
City, Allenspark, Ward, and Estes Park are in conversations about the formation of a Peak-to-Peak
regional housing authority. The Peak-to-Peak Housing Authority could better serve the unique needs of
the mountain communities in the Peak-to-Peak region and would help coordinate resources for these
communities in an efficient manner.

OBJECTIVE 4:
**Create and Preserve Affordable Housing**

Local governments have two primary tools for influencing the creation and
preservation of affordable housing, (1) through the regulatory environment
and (2) through financial support. Local governments can influence how and where affordable housing
development and redevelopment occurs through their zoning code, land use regulations, and building
regulations and through incentives such as expedited permitting or waived development impact fees.
Zoning codes and land use regulations can further codify inclusionary requirements for affordable
housing through inclusionary zoning or allowing for reduced permitting costs and approval times for
affordable housing development. Several of the land use and zoning regulations recommendations
that influence the town’s ability to provide for new housing and more affordable housing have been

```
Housing 43
```

```
covered in the Land Use Chapter of this comprehensive plan, and further elaborated as actions 1-5 in
this chapter. Often affordable housing units are not produced by the market alone, and usually require
subsidies from federal, state, and local governments or other creative partnerships with non-profit
organizations to reduce the up-front costs of developing affordable units. Further considerations on how
the town can support the development and formation of affordable housing from the financial angle are
outlined as actions 7-9 in this chapter.
```
```
OBJECTIVE 5:
Help Households Access and Afford Homes
```
```
During the community open house, participants voted on factors contributing
to housing needs in Nederland. The factor with the most votes was rising
rents and utility costs. There are several renter assistance strategies that local governments can leverage
to reduce the rental barriers on residents. To help offset the impacts to housing need in the Town of
Nederland related to high rental costs and instability, the Town of Nederland should consider strategies
focused on rental assistance policies and programs.
```
```
Homeownership can be an important component of a household’s housing and financial journey. In
communities with a low stock of rental housing, homeownership can sometimes be the only solution
for households that choose to remain in a community but require different housing to meet their
changing needs or for households that are considering relocating to said community. For many first-
time homebuyers, buying a home can be a very expensive and uncertain endeavor. The up-front costs
of an initial down payment, as well as considerations regarding mortgage terms and interest rates can
be barriers to homeownership for low and moderate-income households. Through a variety of different
funding and regulatory programs and policies, local governments have several tools at their disposal
to help households in their community make homeownership more financially attainable, reduce the
barriers to homeownership for low-income households, and expand opportunities for folks looking to
remain in a home. Actions 10 – 17 outlined in the next section of the Housing chapter go into greater
detail on the types of funding tools and regulatory tools the Town of Nederland can leverage to help
households access and afford rental and for-sale homes.
```
**44 Comprehensive Plan** 2024 **Update**


**STRATEGIES**

1. Affordability Considerations: The Town of Nederland could further build upon the implementation
    of the 2023 HNA by codifying the affordability requirements needed to receive incentive packages.
    These defining criteria were developed to allow the Town of Nederland to identify what types of
    decisions are needed to be eligible for funding opportunities to support affordable housing:
    - Must serve households at or less than 100% AMI for developers to receive an incentive. For
       affordable housing targeting HUD funds, consider at or less than 80% AMI.
    - The proportion of the units in a new development that must be set aside as affordable should
       range from 5-20%.
    - Units must remain affordable for between 15-60 years and perhaps in perpetuity.
    - Deed restrictions are an effective tool for enforcing affordability requirements.

2. Accessory Dwelling Units: The Housing Needs Assessment recommended that the Town of
    Nederland amend the Nederland Municipal Code to allow Accessory Dwelling Units to be
    constructed before primary/principal units. On December 5, 2023, the Town Board of Trustees
    adopted this recommendation by amending section 16-98 within Ordinance 850. A future policy
    recommendation includes adjusting the town Code to be even more friendly to Accessory Dwelling
    Units. Town should also consider allowing more than one ADU on properties that are still able
    to meet the yard and bulk requirements associated with the parcel’s associated zoning district
    requirements.
3. Density Bonus Program: The HNA recommends a density bonus program, allowing for more
    units on a parcel of land or within a larger development in exchange for including a percentage
    of affordable units. Currently, Section 16-88 of the Code provides slight allowances for density
    bonuses in the Neighborhood Commercial District, but these provisions should be expanded
    to all residential zoning districts. From the HNA: “It is also recommended that Section 16-88 be
    transformed into a standalone section of the Nederland Municipal Code that outlines the density
    bonus program for each zone district and details variations in density allowances based on provided
    affordability considerations in development proposals.” To establish this program, the town will
    need to define what qualifies as ‘affordable’ (see strategy 1) and determine the required percentage
    of affordable units needed to qualify for the bonus. A typical requirement for qualifying for a density
    bonus might be to provide 10-20% of units as affordable. This strategy aligns with DOLA’s HB1271
    recommendations for increasing affordable housing.
4. Expedited Development Review Process: The Housing Needs Assessment recommended that the
    Town of Nederland develop and adopt a new Administrative Variance ordinance for Chapter 16
    of the Nederland Municipal Code which provides administrative relief and outlines an expedited
    process for housing developments in the Town of Nederland. Section 16-235. On December 5,
    2023, a Residential Development Administrative Variance was adopted by the Board of Trustees,
    within Ordinance 851. In the future, the Town of Nederland could take this even further. A key
    theme in the HNA planning process was the need for implementing an expedited development
    review process with the identified goals of decreasing proposal resubmissions, decreasing review
    timelines, and clarifying expectations of property owners, developers, town staff, and consultants.
    The following steps were recommended to outline this process:
    - Determine an appropriate/expedited development review timeline for affordable housing
       development and adopt by resolution.
    - Complete a contract amendment with the town’s third-party development review consultant to
       enforce expedited affordable housing development review requirements.
    - Outline the development review process and develop a checklist to expedite housing
       development proposals.
5. Decrease Development Review Fees, Impact Fees, and Associated Development Fees: The
    Housing Needs Assessment noted that during the engagement process community members and
    stakeholders noted the substantial plant investment fees (PIFs) associated with housing development
    as a financial barrier that is difficult to navigate – and one that potentially diminishes any possibility of
    affordability for the subsequent housing unit renter or owner. The following fees were identified as
    barriers to efficient (and by extension, affordable) housing development:
    - The town should consider imposing a one-time utility tap and plant investment fee based on lot
       size or unit size for new residential connections. This type of fee structure can incentivize smaller
       units and decrease the development cost of a new housing unit. This type of strategy is being
       evaluated under the current ongoing rate study.

**46 Comprehensive Plan** 2024 **Update**


- Complete the new rate study as indicated above.
- Consider a decrease or fee waiver for building and zoning-related fees for affordable housing
    developments. This decrease could follow the following formats:
    - Flat: Consider whether a flat monetary decrease could be targeted at 80-120% AMI housing
       projects.
    - Percentage: Consider a percentage decrease in fees based on the number of affordable units
       provided in multifamily apartments (market rate and affordable).
    - Remove the Town’s fees from building permits for affordable housing developments and only
       charge the pass-through fee to cover consultant development review costs.
6. Implement additional qualifying 1271 Strategies: From the list of qualifying strategies, the strategies
numbered 1 through 5 are already established and strategies 6 through 8 are under consideration
by the town. Strategies 9 through 13 are recommended as appropriate considerations that the town
has not yet acted on or are not currently under consideration by the town. Finally, the strategies
numbered 14 and 15 should be reviewed over time to determine whether these actions are
appropriate tools for the town.

```
Final List of Qualifying Strategies (to be Eligible for Incentives Grants):
a. The use of vacant publicly owned real property within the local government for
```
- development of affordable housing;
- Granting duplexes, triplexes, or other appropriate multi-family housing options as a use-by-
    right in single-family residential zoning districts;
b. Authorizing accessory dwelling units as a use by-right on parcels in single-family zoning districts
that meet the safety and infrastructure capacity considerations of local governments;
c. Allowing planned unit developments with integrated affordable housing units;
d. Allowing the development of small square footage residential unit sizes;
e. Other novel, innovative, or creative approaches to incentivize affordable housing development.

for affordable housing development;
g. The creation of an expedited development review process for affordable housing aimed at
households the annual income of which is at or below one hundred twenty percent of the area
median income of households of that size in the county in which the housing is located;
h. The establishment of a density bonus program to increase the construction of units that meet
critical housing needs in the local community;
i. The creation of an expedited development review process for acquiring or repurposing

j. The classification of a proposed affordable housing development as a use by right when it meets
the building density and design standards of a given zoning district;
k. Lessened minimum parking requirements for new affordable housing developments;
l. The creation of a land donation, land acquisition, or land banking program;
m. An inclusionary zoning ordinance (per CRS 29-20-104(1)); and
n. With respect to water utility charges, the creation of processes to promote the use of
o. sub-metering of utility charges for affordable housing projects and the creation of expertise in
water utility matters dedicated to affordable housing projects;

7. Potential Redevelopment of Existing Vacant Parcels: The Town of Nederland has existing vacant/
    underutilized land - see Figure 2.3 Land Use Categories Visualized as Percent of Total Area in the
    Land Use Chapter for locations of these parcels. A consideration for the Town of Nederland in
    partnership with the development community is identifying which of these vacant/underutilized
    parcels can be developed followed by the potential redevelopment of these parcels for new
    residential uses. Where any of these vacant parcels are publicly owned, an additional strategy could
    be the discounted sale of publicly owned property for affordable housing development, on parcels
    that do not have significant resource or recreational value. The cost of land can often be one of the
    highest costs associated with housing development. Discounting the sale of land under the control
    of public entities could have the potential to spur interest from the private sector and non-profit
    housing developers.
8. Tax Abatements or Exemptions: Property tax abatements for multi-family housing development or
    housing development that includes affordable housing units can be a tool that local governments
    offer to developers to incentivize new housing construction. Tax abatements reduce the amount of
    taxes owed for a specific time and reduce the property’s assessed value or rate of taxation, which
    lowers the overall tax bill. For developers, this can be an enticing opportunity to have developments,
    especially housing developments that include subsidized units, pencil.
9. Community Land Trusts: Community land trusts are a mechanism for spurring long-term
    affordable home-ownership opportunities in a community by having the community land trust
    retain ownership of the land on which housing units are developed and allowing the homebuyer to
    purchase only the home that is situated on the land. Community land trusts are a form of shared-
    equity homeownership. Under the traditional community land trust model, the land trust maintains
    ownership of the land and leases it out for affordable housing uses. This is typically done by selling
    the structure (whether a single-family home or a unit in a multifamily building) to an eligible buyer,
    along with a long-term ground lease (typically 99 years) that specifies the terms under which the
    home may be sold. Under this model, home buyers own the building (or attached unit) and lease the
    land from the land trust. Purchasers are often individual homeowners but can also be co-operatives
    or non-profit housing organizations or developers. As owners of the land, the land trust maintains
    a degree of control over initial and subsequent uses. These rights include an option to repurchase
    the buildings when the owner wishes to sell, control over the resale price, and limits on eligible
    future purchasers and the use of the building or unit. Owners typically pay a monthly ground lease
    fee which covers administrative costs and costs associated with property ownership, such as taxes,
    or repairs and maintenance. Homeowners build wealth in two ways: (1) through the forced savings
    gained by paying down the principal balance of their mortgage, and (2) through the share of home
    price appreciation allocated to them under the land trust’s resale formula which is different per land
    trust. Community land trusts are typically administered by a non-profit organization or a quasi-
    governmental organization, such as a special district and usually have a governing body that consists
    of members of the public, home purchasers in the land trust, and governmental representatives.
10. Rights of First Refusal: Rights of first refusal are contractual rights afforded to an interested party
    that allow the interested party the first right to purchase a property before going to the broader
    market or next interested party. The Town of Nederland can use rights of first refusal to preserve
    and create affordable housing in two different ways. First, rights of first refusal can help preserve
    existing affordable housing units by giving the Town of Nederland or a mission-driven non-profit
    organization with close ties to the Town of Nederland, the opportunity to purchase subsidized
    rental housing units when the owner of a subsidized housing unit(s) stops participating in the
    subsidy program. Second, the Town of Nederland could use the rights of first refusal to purchase
    existing non-subsidized rental housing units when the rental property goes up for sale. Rights of first
    refusal can be a helpful tool for local governments so that they have an option to purchase rental

**48 Comprehensive Plan** 2024 **Update**


```
housing units before going on the broader market. Rights of first refusal can also be a helpful anti-
displacement tool to keep renters in existing affordable housing units in their units.
```
11. Rent Regulation: Rental regulation policies where local governments regulate the amount that
    landlords can increase rents year-over-year. This strategy allows renters to have a greater degree of
    predictability in their anticipated rental costs by not being subjected to dramatic rent increases.
12. Just Cause Eviction Policy: Just cause eviction policies are a policy tool that local governments can
    use to limit the grounds upon which a landlord may evict a tenant. In most places, landlords are not
    required to provide a reason for a tenant’s eviction, and these just cause policies can help tenants
    maintain a degree of residential stability by narrowing the scope of allowable grounds for eviction.
13. Legal Assistance Programs: Legal assistance programs for at-risk renters are a less common strategy
    among local governments for tenant assistance, however, local governments around the county
    implement programs to expand access to legal services and legal counsel for low-income renters in
    their communities who are facing eviction or dealing with other serious housing issues such as fair
    housing discrimination or hazardous living conditions.
14. HOME Tenant-Based Rental Assistance & Local Service Providers: The HOME Investment
    Partnership Program (HOME) provides formula-based block grants that localities and states can use
    to support different activities related to affordable housing, such as expanding the amount of tenant-
    based rental assistance that local jurisdictions and states can provide to low-income households.
    Cities, towns, and counties have authority to tailor tenant-based rental assistance through the
    HOME program to meet specific needs, including limiting program eligibility to specific groups (e.g.,
    seniors, persons with a disability, etc.), and providing additional types of assistance to complement
    the tenant-based rental assistance, such as security deposits and help to cover utility costs.
    Additionally, the town could partner with Canyon Cares, a local non-profit service provider, to
    find financial assistance for low-income families needing short-term housing support. The town can
    play a proactive role in preventing displacement by connecting renter and homeowner households
    with local service providers such as Canyon Cares before households face lasting challenges such as
    eviction or foreclosure.
15. Housing Choice Vouchers: The Town of Nederland could leverage their partnership with the
    Boulder County Housing Authority to manage the Housing Choice Voucher program that is
    administered by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and managed
    locally by public housing agencies. The Housing Choice Voucher program is the largest rental
    assistance program that HUD manages. The program allows participants to select rental housing
    that meets the program standards and then contributes a share of their income (usually around
    30%) towards rent and utilities while the public housing agency (Boulder County Housing Authority
    in this case), using funds from the Housing Choice Voucher program, pays the remaining balance
    directly to the landlord.
16. Up-Front Financial Assistance: It is not uncommon for low-income households to lack the necessary
    funds to cover a security deposit and required prepaid rent such as first/last month up-front. Public
    agencies can provide security deposit and first/last month rent expenses on behalf of low-income
    renters as a grant that is paid directly to landlords. The Town of Nederland could re-direct funds
    from impact fees associated with new development to build up a grant pool to administer for low-
    income or first-time renters to cover these up-front, prepaid expenses to reduce the barrier of
    access to rental housing units.

```
Cities, towns and counties have the option to develop programs to reduce the up-front costs of
home purchases through forgivable loans, low/no interest loans, or grants that can cover costs such
```
```
Housing 49
```

```
as down payments or closing costs. It is not uncommon for households to be able to afford the
monthly mortgage of a home, but not have the accumulated savings to be able to purchase a home
given the initial expenses associated with home purchases. Structured as grants, forgivable loans,
no- or low-interest loans, or deferred loans, community down payment and closing cost assistance
programs can help families who lack savings become successful homeowners.
```
```
Grants from local governments, or public housing authorities have the benefit of less administrative
burden than publicly provided loans and do not require repayment, however, the pool of funding
that generates the grants cannot always expect to be recaptured so they are typically a better
application when the amount of up-front payment assistance is lower, typically $5,000 or less, so
that the overall funding pool can be spread further. Structuring the assistance as a loan that must be
repaid allows local governments to re-administer the funds; different families can be helped as loans
are paid off. Recycling funds adds complexity and requires oversight, which can be a cumbersome
requirement for local government staff. However, these publicly provided loans can significantly
increase the scale of impact that limited resources provide, particularly in high-cost markets where
down payment and closing cost assistance can amount to a substantial per-unit subsidy. Structuring
down payment assistance as a loan works well in housing markets and locations where home values
are steady or rising, as is the case in the Town of Nederland. A worthwhile consideration is that if
home prices decline, it can be difficult for borrowers to repay these loans. Since it can be difficult to
predict downturns in the housing market, cities, towns, and counties may wish to consider policies
that forgive these loans in the event of such a downturn.
```
```
Cities and counties can use some federal funds, including HUD’s HOME Investment Partnership
and Community Development Block Grant program funds, to fund down payment and closing
cost assistance programs. Cities and counties can also use locally generated funds exclusively or to
supplement federal funding.
```
17. Employer-Assisted Housing: Employer-assisted housing programs can be an effective way to leverage
    the resources of larger employers in a region that can help employees afford housing near their
    work through a variety of ways including downpayment assistance on for-sale housing units, rental
    subsidies, or the direct investment in or construction of new housing units. This is often a successful
    endeavor when one employer is contributing to a higher percentage of local employment. For the
    Town of Nederland, this could include a partnership with Eldora Ski Resort to provide housing for
    folks who are employed by Eldora Ski Resort and live, or want to live, in The Town of Nederland.
18. Amending Building Codes: Building construction codes are an important safeguard to ensure that
    housing units are safe for human habitation. Building codes are typically used to regulate residential
    and non-residential building construction and can address things like plumbing, mechanical, electrical,
    and energy in a construction project. It is typical that local governments adopt model codes
    developed by national or international standards organizations like the International Code Council.
    These codes are then enforced through plan review when new development and redevelopment
    projects are initiated. These model codes can often be a helpful tool and baseline for local
    governments to feel confident that they are administering reasonable, and appropriate codes that
    influence the safety and habitability of buildings in their communities. These codes can also have
    requirements in construction standards and building regulations that raise costs associated with the
    project development but do little to make a building safer. For example, older codes may eliminate
    the use of new high-performance low-cost construction materials such as structured-insulated-
    panels that can reduce time and money on a building development project but may not be used due
    to a building code that restricts these materials. A first step for most local governments in reducing
    barriers to housing construction while ensuring high-quality housing is being built safely is to ensure
    that they are using the latest version of a model code from the International Code Council, then

**50 Comprehensive Plan** 2024 **Update**


```
going through a self-audit to ensure that there are not any unnecessarily cumbersome requirements
that are doing little to protect safety and blocking new developments.
```
19. Square Footage Cap: The Town of Nederland could consider codifying a square footage cap on
    the habitable space associated with new single-unit residential buildings, not including garages or
    basements. This strategy would have the benefit of reducing the impact that large homes have on
    the home values in the surrounding market. Large homes have the effect of driving up median home
    value in the surrounding area which drives up home values of even more modestly sized homes
    and can lead to decreased affordability in a housing market even if smaller homes, and multi-unit
    homes are present. This would also incentivize smaller single unit construction which could help
    the town increase the number of missing middle housing units. Associated benefits also include
    smaller demands on the local utility network and increasing energy efficiency amongst new single
    unit residential buildings. Routt County, Colorado, a rural county in the mountains is currently
    considering a square footage cap of 7,500 square feet in order to reduce the impact of large homes
    on affordability in the region.
20. Regulating Short-term Rentals: Local governments, especially in mountain resort areas, are
    increasingly regulating short-term rentals. Short-term rentals are furnished rooms, homes,
    apartments, or other existing housing that is rented out on a short-term basis, typically less than
    one year. Short term rentals are typically rented out by a small-scale guest hosting operation, or the
    owner of the home The fluid nature of short-term rental markets—which involve multiple hosts
    independently deciding whether and when to host a rental and through dozens of online platforms
    have led many local governments to consider regulating these short-term rentals to mitigate the
    potential effect that short-term rentals have on constraining the supply of existing housing units
    that could be used for residents that are instead being used commercially to host short-term
    non-residents. In 2022, the voters in the Town of Nederland approved an increase in the lodging
    occupation tax, which applies to short-term rentals, to a total of $4 per day per number of defined
    bedrooms in the unit which took effect on January 1, 2023. Should the Town of Nederland decide
    to add additional regulations on short-term rentals, the town will likely want to consider a range of
    policy options. Among the key regulatory tools available are:
    - Monitoring of short-term rentals: Localities may require short-term rentals to register or acquire
       permits, which may include measures to protect the safety of tenants and mitigate potential
       disturbances for neighbors.
    - Caps on the number of short-term rentals: Localities may choose to restrict the total number of
       permitted units in certain neighborhoods, zoning districts, or the town.
    - Limits on the frequency of rentals: Localities may limit the number of nights a property can be
       rented as a short-term rental.
    - Managing the location of short-term rental units and the density/concentration of short-term
       rental units.
    - Restrictions on tenants: Localities may consider limiting the number of tenants who can stay in a
       short-term rental.
    - Prohibiting certain types of short-term rentals: Localities might ban dedicated or investor-owned
       short-term rentals.

**52 Comprehensive Plan** 2024 **Update**


## Introduction

This chapter lays the foundation for the vision, goals, and policies that will direct Nederland’s approach
to recreation initiatives within the town and surrounding lands. The concepts in this chapter were
developed through conversations with stakeholders about the needs of the community, an analysis of
existing recreation offerings, and public input on needs, opportunities, and top priorities for recreation.
This chapter includes actionable policies to advance Nederland’s recreation goals and offerings. These
policies are intended to help keep Nederland active, engaged in the community, and physically and
mentally healthy through both active and passive recreation options. A thriving recreation scene
contributes to human health and wellbeing, a core pillar of the City Resilience Index.

## Existing Conditions and Key Issues

**THE RECREATION LANDSCAPE**

As a result of its position surrounded by public lands and breathtaking mountain scenery, much of
Nederland’s recreational opportunities are defined by outdoor offerings such as hiking, mountain biking,
and skiing. Traditional recreation, like sports programming, classes and clinics, and athletic facilities,
are also a crucial part of recreation in Nederland but are less developed than the outdoor recreation
opportunities are. When considering the recreation opportunities available to residents in Nederland, it
is important to consider the regional scale due to the abundance of trails and public lands outside town
boundaries. These recreational features, though under the control of other governing bodies such as the
United States Forest Service (USFS) and Boulder County, play an important role in supplementing in-
town recreational offerings. The core recreational sites in and immediately surrounding Nederland are
shown in the following recreation map (Figure 4.1).

```
Recreation 53
```

```
SPORTS FIELDS, PLAYGROUNDS, & RECREATIONAL
AMENITIES
Nederland has several parks that offer residents access to sports fields and courts, playgrounds,
skateparks, picnic tables, and natural scenery. The Guercio Memorial Park, Nederland Ice and Racquet
Park, and Nederland Middle-High School offer residents access to various fields and courts such as a
baseball field, tennis courts, and ice rink, and a well-maintained track and football field.
```
```
Nederland’s main park is Chipeta Park, which includes picnic tables, a shelter, play equipment, swings,
and a small pond. It is easily accessible from First Street and Downtown via pedestrian trails. Adjacent
to Chipeta Park is Veterans Memorial Park, featuring trails, benches, and a veteran's memorial. Joe Smith
Park, the Nathan Lazarus Skatepark, Tom Riley Park, and various pocket parks provide additional in-
town recreational spaces.
```
```
OUTDOOR RECREATION
Nederland has an extensive, though incomplete, pedestrian dirt trail system that connects key
destinations like Downtown, Chipeta Park, Boulder Creek, neighborhoods, and the Community Center.
This network enhances connectivity and offers pleasant walking experiences in town.
```
```
Outside of town there are several large open spaces and public lands with trail networks providing
access to hiking, mountain biking, and scenic views. These include the West Magnolia trails (USFS), Mud
Lake (Boulder County), Barker Reservoir Recreation Area (City of Boulder), and Caribou Ranch Open
Space (Boulder County).
```
```
Outdoor recreation opportunities in the area can draw significant visitation and drives tourism. For
example, in the winter Eldora Mountain resort and Nordic skiing opportunities on the 4th of July Road
and Mud Lake Open Space bring several visitors. In the summer, mountain biking, camping, fishing, and
hunting draw several visitors to public lands in the area such as the Indian Peaks Wilderness. Boulder
Canyon provides ample opportunities for rock climbing as a premier climbing destination with hundreds
of sport and traditional routes between Boulder and Nederland.
```
**54 Comprehensive Plan** 2024 **Update**


FIGURE 4.1

**NEDERLAND RECREATION AMENITIES**


**KEY ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

```
MAINTENANCE, FUNDING, AND CAPACITY
Funding and staff capacity are the core challenges in the maintenance and delivery of recreational assets
in town. However, continued efforts to find funding through grants could help provide new recreational
assets, and non-profits and volunteer groups are excellent resources to continue maintaining existing
trails and parks in town. Before building new infrastructure, maintenance of existing parks and facilities is
the top priority. Proposals for new facilities should only move forward when there are clear mechanisms
for initial funding as well as continued operations and maintenance of the facility.
```
```
TOURISM IMPACTS AND OPPORTUNITIES
Because the recreational offerings around Nederland are so desirable, they serve not only as local
destinations but also as tourist destinations. Traffic from Front-Range communities visiting Eldora
Mountain Resort and nearby trailheads presents challenges with congestion but also provides economic
opportunities for travel and tourism-supporting industries.
```
```
INDOOR RECREATION FACILITY NEEDS AND UPGRADES
The two most significant recreation facility needs in Nederland are an indoor pool and upgrades to the
Community Center. In 2024, the community's most frequently expressed need was for a pool, hot tub,
and sauna facility, a recommendation also highlighted in the 2013 PROST plan.
```
```
The Community Center, a central hub for recreation, offers a fitness center and various sports, dance,
and social programs. However, it requires several renovations to maintain its functionality, including
addressing the condemned West Wing and improving site circulation. Addressing these issues will
ensure the Community Center continues to meet the community's recreational needs.
```
```
OUTDOOR RECREATION FACILITY NEEDS AND UPGRADES
Community members have expressed interest in developing the west shore of Barker Meadow
Reservoir to provide water-based recreational opportunities and create a direct link to Downtown.
Currently, swimming and boating at the reservoir are prohibited. Although a master plan was created
in 2013 to revitalize this area, those improvements have not been implemented. Despite financial
and intergovernmental challenges, there is ongoing interest in adding trails around the reservoir and
developing a performance stage in the proposed Gateway Park area.
```
```
In 2024, the most frequently expressed outdoor recreation need was for increased pedestrian trail
connectivity in town. While Nederland has a unique system of gravel paths linking key neighborhoods
to Downtown and Chipeta Park, there are gaps in the network, and the trails lack ADA accessibility.
Improving trail connectivity was also a key objective in the 2013 PROST plan.
```
**56 Comprehensive Plan** 2024 **Update**


**ENGAGEMENT RECAP**

The following section summarizes the emerging themes from our community engagement around the
topic of recreation. For more information about our engagement process, please read the community
engagement summary in the introduction chapter.

**_WHAT WAS HEARD_**

When asked what kind of indoor and outdoor recreational offerings are currently missing in Nederland,
there was strong support for the idea of developing a swimming pool facility of some kind. The survey
strongly supported this outcome, with 15 out of 36 write-in comments specifically mentioning the desire
for an indoor pool facility. Other common responses included a dog park, pump track, and outdoor
event space/stage. There was also a significant number of respondents indicating a need for expanding
the in-town pedestrian trails with better connectivity to neighborhoods like the Big Springs Community,
increasing the accessibility of trail networks, and better wayfinding. When asked to prioritize which
initiatives to focus on related to parks and recreation, the most support was for strategies like
maintaining indoor and outdoor recreation facilities and local trail systems. New facilities were less of
a priority, except for indoor recreation facilities and new trail connections to surrounding public lands
which were still rated highly. When asked questions about maintaining facilities or developing new ones,
there was a slight preference for maintaining existing facilities as a priority.

Overall, the responses were indicative of a community that values recreation and open space in general,
with particular emphasis on conservation, developing trails, and maintaining existing facilities. Additional
recreational programming and educational initiatives were the only policies that the community did not
identify as particularly important.

## Recreation Vision Statement

```
Our community and its visitors enjoy a well-connected, ecologically sound,
well-maintained, and accessible parks, open space, and trail system with
recreational and cultural services and facilities while protecting and
enhancing the unique mountain ecosystem of which we are a part.
```
## Objectives & Strategies

```
OBJECTIVE 1:
Prioritize the Maintenance and Operations of Successful
Pre-Existing Recreation Facilities
```
```
Nederland will prioritize maintaining and enhancing existing recreational
facilities to ensure they continue offering high-quality experiences for residents and visitors. The
primary focus will be on key amenities such as Chipeta Park, the Community Center, and town trails
along Central Boulder Creek, given their high usage and significance to the community. Securing the
necessary funding and staffing to maintain these facilities is the critical first priority before considering
the development of new recreational amenities. Efforts will also include community engagement through
volunteer programs and the reassessment of less successful programs to reinvest resources where they
are most effective.
```
```
OBJECTIVE 2:
Support and Expand Indoor Recreation Opportunities
```
```
Nederland will emphasize opportunities to expand and support indoor recreation
opportunities. While outdoor recreation opportunities already abound, indoor activities for
residents during colder months are more limited. To expand these opportunities, the town will work
to renovate and improve the Community Center, ensuring high-quality programmable space for fitness
classes, social events and activities, and more. The maintenance of existing recreation facilities will be a
funding priority, with new programs and facilities typically needing additional fundraising efforts such as
through grants, donations, or the intentional allocation of parks budget whenever possible. Nederland
Staff will investigate opportunities for a community pool facility.
```
```
Connection to Resilience: Health and Well-being
```
```
OBJECTIVE 3:
Incrementally Improve In-Town Trail Networks and Pocket Parks
```
```
Nederland will prioritize the gradual expansion and enhancement of its in-town trail network
and pocket parks to improve connectivity and accessibility. The Town will actively seek
opportunities to connect existing trails to new key destinations and neighborhoods, ensuring that
residents and visitors can easily navigate between parks, plazas, downtown areas, and neighborhoods on
foot.
```
```
As outlined in the Downtown Subarea Plan, potential locations for pocket parks and plazas within the
downtown subarea will be identified, evaluated, and developed incrementally. The focus will be on
creating a cohesive network of trails and green spaces that enhance the pedestrian experience and
provide accessible recreational areas throughout town.
```
**58 Comprehensive Plan** 2024 **Update**


OBJECTIVE 4:
**Expand Outdoor Recreation Offerings Near Barker Meadow Reservoir**

Celebrate Barker Meadow and the reservoir as the eastern entrance to Nederland through
continued efforts to enhance the area’s natural beauty and to sustainably satisfy several
of Nederland’s cultural and recreational needs. Nederland will actively pursue the expansion of
recreational opportunities between the west end of Barker Meadow Reservoir and the eastern edge of
downtown. Key areas of focus will include evaluating the feasibility of developing an amphitheater and
multi-use field space for community events and recreational activities.

In alignment with the recommendations of the Downtown Subarea Plan, the town will consider master
planning this zone to create a cohesive connection between the reservoir as a recreational asset and
downtown as the town center. This will involve a comprehensive approach to land use, infrastructure,
and design, ensuring that these areas complement one another and enhance the overall experience for
residents and visitors.

Nederland will also continue discussions with the City of Boulder to renegotiate agreements that could
expand recreational uses of the reservoir, including the possibility of introducing paddle sports and
swimming. This effort will involve exploring regulatory, environmental, and safety considerations to
ensure that any new activities are sustainable and beneficial for the community.

**STRATEGIES**

1. Maintenance and Operations Plan - Develop detailed maintenance priorities and operating plans
    for the upkeep of existing trails and parks. This plan should include regular assessments of facility
    conditions, a maintenance schedule, and a resource allocation strategy.
2. Program Evaluation and Reinvestment - Identify the most and least successful recreation programs
    based on popularity, community impact, and satisfaction levels. Prioritize and reinvest in successful
    programs while considering the discontinuation of less effective ones to redirect funds to higher-
    impact areas.
3. Develop a Trail and Park Maintenance Volunteer Program - Develop a robust volunteer program
    focused on trail and park maintenance. Engage residents, community groups, and schools in
    organized efforts to maintain and enhance town trails and parks. Offer training, tools, and incentives
    to volunteers, and establish a regular schedule for volunteer maintenance events.
4. Budget Exploration - Explore opportunities to increase the parks and recreation budget, with a
    focus on securing funds for maintenance. Once maintenance liabilities are adequately covered,
    investigate options for future investments in recreational facilities.
5. Community Center Renovation Plan - Develop and implement a comprehensive renovation plan
    for the Community Center, focusing on creating versatile, high-quality spaces for fitness, social
    events, and community programs. This plan should include upgrades to existing facilities, improved
    accessibility, and renovations to the west wing.
6. Feasibility Study for Indoor Pool - Conduct a feasibility study to investigate the potential for
    developing an indoor pool facility. This study should assess community demand, site suitability, cost
    estimates, and potential funding sources. Engage with community members and stakeholders to
    gauge interest and gather input.
7. Trail Network Expansion Plan - Establish a formal plan to expand the in-town trail network,
    prioritizing connections to key destinations like schools, parks, downtown, and residential
    neighborhoods. This plan would include a phased timeline for implementation, funding sources, and
    specific areas targeted for new trails.
8. Green Open Space Development - Integrate green infrastructure and sustainable practices into the
    development of trails, pocket parks, and plazas. This could include using permeable materials, native
    landscaping, and stormwater management systems.
9. Barker Reservoir Feasibility Study - Conduct a feasibility study for the development of an
    amphitheater and multi-use field space. Start with the Nederland Gateway Park Area Master Plan
    from 2013 and evaluate what concepts are still feasible and which are not. This updated effort
    should assess site suitability, potential environmental impacts, cost estimates, and community
    demand. Secure funding for the study through grants or partnerships and engage consultants with
    expertise in recreational planning and design.
10. Intergovernmental Collaboration with Boulder - Continue negotiations with the City of Boulder
    to explore the potential for expanding recreational activities at Barker Meadow Reservoir, such as
    paddle sports and swimming. This effort should include discussions on regulatory, environmental,
    and safety considerations to ensure any new activities are sustainable and beneficial for the
    community.

## Introduction

This chapter identifies the existing transportation challenges in Nederland as well as opportunities to
improve transportation safety, enhance transportation options for all ages and abilities, and improve
circulation through and to town. This chapter provides priorities for advancing transportation
infrastructure as demand for travel in Nederland increases and a desire to travel by foot, bike, or
transit grows. Recommendations include improving the roadway network through traffic calming and
intersection enhancements, implementing new and upgrading existing sidewalks and trails, enhancing
transit services and programs, developing programs to advance multimodal transportation options, and
implementing parking management strategies.

## Existing Conditions & Key Issues

Nederland is seeing increased traffic to and through town, and increased demand on roadway and
parking infrastructure; however, few significant transportation system improvements have been made
over the last decade. Downtown Nederland has limited and narrow sidewalks and limited pedestrian
crossings. Transit access in Nederland is regionally focused and infrequent, primarily connecting people
to communities and destinations adjacent to and around Nederland, rather than within the town.
Additionally, parking is not intuitive and challenging to navigate. The north and south ends of Nederland
are connected by a single two-lane bridge over Middle Boulder Creek, posing a challenge in the case of
a flood or emergency evacuation. There are no traffic lights in the town; instead, there is a roundabout
in the center of town that connects Highway 119, 2nd Street, and North Bridge Street. There are three
roads that provide access into and out of Nederland— (1) Highway 119/Peak to Peak Highway, (2)
Highway 119/Boulder Canyon, and (3) Highway 72/Peak to Peak Highway. Limited access into and out of
town provides challenges during a potential evacuation or peak demand days.

**ROADWAY NETWORK**

The Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) collects annual average daily traffic (AADT)
data at eight different locations within the Nederland town boundary. The highest AADT counts are
in the center of the Town, with 6,400 average vehicles per day as the highest count. The posted speed
limit throughout most of the local roadways in Nederland is 15 miles per hour (mph) and goes up to 35
mph on small segments of roadway. The posted speed limit for the sections of Highway 119 within the
majority of town is 25 mph. South of Eldora Road, the posted speed limit of Highway 119 is 35 mph.

**BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN NETWORK**

Throughout town, there are limited pedestrian facilities and no dedicated on-street bicycle facilities.
Most of the sidewalks in town are concentrated in the central downtown area and are a mix of primarily
concrete or gravel. The sidewalks that are composed of gravel and other non-concrete materials do
not meet the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) standards for accessibility. In addition to sidewalks,
Nederland has a network of both formal and informal trails. Informal trails are generally unmarked
desire lines that have been created by pedestrians. There are two formal trails that connect to the
sidewalks in the downtown area as well as a cluster of trails in the northwest region of town.

There are a total of 14 marked crosswalks, mostly concentrated in the downtown area; most crosswalks
have associated signage, and all crossings are uncontrolled (i.e. there are no flashing beacons or signals
located at crossing locations). The paint of many of these crosswalks is faded due to the snow, plows,
heavy vehicle traffic, and wear and tear over time. Pedestrian and bicycle facilities are shown in Figure
5.1.

**TRANSIT SERVICES**

The Town of Nederland is currently serviced by three fixed-route transit options and four paratransit
services. The fixed route services are the NB route operated by RTD, the Hessie Shuttle operated
by Boulder County, and Mountain Rides operated by Peak-to-Peak Transportation. The connection
between the NB route and Hessie Shuttle allows travelers from Boulder to travel to the Hessie
trailhead with just one transfer. While these transit services connect travelers regionally, there is
no local transit service exclusive to Nederland. In addition to fixed-route service, the four different
paratransit services available in Nederland are RTD’s Access-a-Ride, RTD’s Access-on-Demand, Via
Mobility, and IntelliRide.

**PARKING**

Parking utilization data was collected by Fehr & Peers on Tuesday, September 26, 2023, from 7:00am-
8:00am, and Sunday, October 1, 2023, from 11:00am-1:00pm at several downtown locations. Parking
occupancy, or utilization, is defined as the number of parked vehicles divided by the total supply of
parking spaces. Parking occupancy around 85% is generally considered to be industry best practice as the
threshold for whether parking is at capacity.

During the weekday morning data collection period, most businesses in Nederland were not yet open
and most residents were assumed to be in their homes. It is assumed that this period reflects the
time of the lowest parking demand for the study area. Most parking locations observed were less than
20% utilized—therefore it is easy to find parking and there is not a parking supply problem during low
demand times.

Weekend parking utilization data was collected during the Nederland Farmer’s Market, the Harvest
Festival, and peak Fall leaf-peeping season. Due to the multiple events and Fall season, this date was
chosen to reflect a peak activity and visitation period in Nederland, when parking demand is at one of its
highest points. Almost all the parking locations observed were above 85% utilization, and in some cases,
over 100% utilization. This means that it can be challenging to find parking and parking management
strategies should be identified. Parking utilization over 100% indicates illegal parking activity. Lack of
clear parking signage denoting parking locations likely contributed to illegal parking activity.

**SAFETY**

Fehr & Peers conducted a crash analysis using DiExSys Road Safety Analytics data from January 1,
2018-December 31, 2022. Non-state-highway and non-intersection crashes were not included in the
analysis due to potential inaccuracies in the spatial location of crash data.

Most of the crashes analyzed are concentrated in the central downtown area of Nederland at the
roundabout and at the intersection of Eldora Road and Highway 119. There are also individual crashes
that occur at curvatures on the road along Highway 119. 68% of crashes resulted in property damage
only (i.e. non-injury crashes). From the five years of crash data analyzed, there was only one fatal crash
due to a head-on collision between a truck and a motorcycle navigating a curve on Highway 72. From
2018-2022, there was one crash involving a person walking at the roundabout and one crash involving
a person bicycling. A map of the crash data is shown in Figure 5.2. In this crash heat map, crash density
was weighted by the level of injury of the crash, with fatal crashes carrying the most weight and property
damage only crashes carrying the least weight.


**66 Comprehensive Plan** 2024 **Update**

## ENGAGEMENT SUMMARY

```
Several areas for improvement along the transportation network were identified during the public and
stakeholder engagement process. Common themes expressed were expanding bicycling and pedestrian
infrastructure, improving transit access, and enhancing roadway comfort and maintenance.
```
**WHAT WAS HEARD**

```
BICYCLING AND PEDESTRIAN INFRASTRUCTURE
Nederland residents, employees, and visitors expressed a desire to improve walking and rolling
infrastructure in Nederland. Desired improvements include improving pedestrian crossings (especially
at the roundabout and Visitors Center), repairing and filling gaps in the sidewalk network (especially
along Highway 119), installing additional pedestrian amenities, improving snow removal on sidewalks,
and installing pedestrian-scale lighting in the downtown area. The community also expressed an interest
in improving trail access and allowing for accessible connections to trails, securing bicycle parking, and
implementing a bike share program.
```
```
The community expressed support for a second pedestrian bridge through town that would be open
to vehicles for emergency use only, as shown in Figure 5.3. There was continued concern about winter
maintenance of pedestrian infrastructure, which will need to be prioritized in the future.
```
```
The most common type of crash during the study period were fixed-object crashes including parked
motor vehicle crashes, which contribute to 30% of all crashes. The second most common types
of crashes were broadside, overturning, and rear end crashes, each representing 14% of crashes.
The least common types of crashes were head on, overtaking turn, bicycle, and pedestrian crashes,
each representing 3% of crashes. These crash locations and crash patterns were used to inform
recommendations.

**_TRANSIT_**

The Nederland community expressed interest in expanded transit service, including increased frequency,
extended service hours, and additional transit routes within the town and the region. Community
members were also interested in improving ease of riding transit by making real-time information on
transit routes and schedules more readily accessible, and by improving bus stops with shade, trash cans,
and benches.

In response to proposed recommendations, Nederland residents supported increased NB frequency,
particularly around peak commuting hours and on the weekends. There was also support for bus stop
improvements and for providing support for elderly and disabled riders. The community expressed
continued interest in a bus service to Eldora Ski Resort for Nederland locals.

**_ROADWAYS_**

The biggest concerns that Nederland residents expressed regarding roadways were maintenance and
parking. There was significant concern about winter roadway maintenance, especially the degradation of
painted street lines. Residents also expressed a desire for better parking management, and potentially
additional parking locations, especially downtown. The community was also interested in improvements
to the roundabout in town, and potentially the construction of additional roundabouts.

The community expressed support for the proposed road improvements. There was widespread
support for geometric modifications and striping and signing enhancements at the intersection of
Highway 119/Lakeview Drive to slow speeds, improve pedestrian safety, and reduce queuing for drivers.
There was emphasis on the need for a turn lane at this location. Community members also supported
similar enhancements at Eldora Road/Highway 119. Community members were generally in favor of
parking management strategies, including paid parking, signage formalizing parking, and loading zones.

**68 Comprehensive Plan** 2024 **Update**

## Vision Statement

```
Nederland’s transportation system is comfortable and accessible for users
of all ages and abilities. Travelers in Nederland have equitable access to
various and sustainable modes of transportation through a connected
network of trails, sidewalks, and roadways. All modes of transportation
including walking, rolling, biking, riding transit, and driving are convenient,
reliable, respect the natural environment while providing access to
recreation, and are supported by programs and policies that can adapt to
emerging mobility and technology.
```
## Objectives & Strategies

```
OBJECTIVE 1:
Prioritize Transportation Equity and Safety
```
```
As a popular destination for visitors and a growing population, Nederland’s
transportation system serves people of all ages, backgrounds, and abilities. As a
result, the transportation system must be comfortable and accessible for all users. The town will
prioritize equity by providing support and signage for non-English speakers, complying with ADA
accessibility requirements throughout transit and pedestrian facilities, and providing transportation
options for users of all ages and abilities. Additionally, the town will prioritize comfort by managing
vehicle speeds, implementing safety improvements at intersections with a crash history, protecting
pedestrians and bicyclists with dedicated crossings and facilities, and strategically utilizing programs and
policies to prioritize people walking, biking, and taking transit.
```
```
OBJECTIVE 2:
Ensure that Walking is Comfortable and Accessible
```
```
By ensuring that it is comfortable and accessible for people walking, Nederland
will be able to reduce traffic impacts and carbon emissions. The town will
promote pedestrian comfort and accessibility by upgrading the existing sidewalk network and expanding
the sidewalk and trail network near key destinations. Formalizing select existing informal trails will
allow residents to walk between key destinations comfortably and efficiently. The town will also ensure
pedestrian comfort by upgrading existing pedestrian crossings and adding additional crossing locations.
Upgrades include a pedestrian signal, roadway narrowing, and colored concrete at crossing locations.
```
```
OBJECTIVE 3:
Increase Regional Transit Options
```
```
Nederland will increase the mobility of its residents and decrease car congestion
by working with RTD to improve regional transit options. These improvements
will allow Nederland residents to travel more easily within their community and access the Eldora
Ski Resort more quickly and will help to manage visitor traffic. Improvements include expanded rural
regional transit, expanded transit to Boulder, expanded transit to Eldora, and new intra-Nederland
transit during peak demand days.

OBJECTIVE 4:
**Maintain Transportation Infrastructure**

Nederland will proactively and consistently maintain its transportation
infrastructure to ensure comfortable road conditions into the future. To do
this, the town will need to consider additional funding sources for additional equipment
and staffing as well as create a pavement and street sweeping plan. This increased investment in and
improvements to maintenance will allow Nederland to prolong the lifespan of its transportation
infrastructure and allow for comfortable travel for years to come.

OBJECTIVE 5:
**Implement Parking Management Strategies**

Nederland will consider and implement parking demand
management strategies. Short-term recommendations are aimed
at addressing potential future challenges in the next five years and are focused on parking demand
management strategies that shift parking demand rather than adding parking supply. Long-term strategies
will be determined based on the effectiveness of short-term strategies but may include expansion of
parking supply.


**70 Comprehensive Plan** 2024 **Update**

**STRATEGIES**

1. Sidewalk and Trail Improvements: Upgrade existing sidewalks and trails and implement new
    sidewalks and trails per the map in the Transportation Plan. This strategy will create a complete and
    connected pedestrian network that will provide access to key destinations and serve as recreation
    for people of all ages and abilities.
2. Enhanced Pedestrian Crossings: Upgrade existing pedestrian crossings with signals and surface
    materials and add new pedestrian crossings where appropriate. Pedestrian signals should be
    considered at the Visitors Center and library to improve pedestrian safety and reduce vehicle delay.
    Denote all striped crosswalks on Highway 119 with colored concrete rather than striping. Lastly,
    implement new pedestrian crossings at Highway 119/Navajo Trail, West 2nd Street/North Jefferson
    Avenue, Highway 119/East Street, and Highway 119/East 3rd Street.
3. Roadway Enhancements at Intersection: Implement improvements at the three intersection
    locations identified in the Transportation Plan: the roundabout, Lakeview Drive/Highway 119, and
    Eldora Road/Highway 119. Upgrade the existing roundabout to meet CDOT standards to effectively
    divert vehicle traffic to slow speeds and improve pedestrian crossings. At Lakeview Drive/Highway
    119, implement turn lanes and receiving lanes. Lastly, at Eldora Road/Highway 119, implement turn
    lanes and receiving lanes in the short-term and a roundabout in the long-term.
4. Traffic Calming Measures: Operating speed data and community concerns both confirm high vehicle
    speeds in town. These high speeds are reported on local roadways as well as state highways. In the
    near term, maintain existing striping and implement a more regular restriping program to counteract
    the impacts of local weather conditions. Maintaining centerline, edge, and crosswalk pavement
    markings can reduce speeds. In the long term, visually narrowing the roadway through centerline
    and shoulder striping and painted bulb outs on local roads can significantly lower traffic speeds.
5. Transportation Programs: Programs related to transportation help expand transportation options
    for travelers. Implement programs including: curbside management to allow for 15-minute pick-
    up/drop-off locations, wayfinding as identified in the DDA Wayfinding Plan that includes key
    destinations and travel distances, and Transportation Demand Management strategies such as
    educational resources and pedestrian amenities.
6. Boulder County Safety Study: Implement projects recommended in the upcoming Boulder County
    Safety Study to address safety concerns based on crash patterns and the high-risk network.
7. Bus Stop Upgrades: Upgrade all bus stops to include an ADA landing pad, adjacent sidewalks,
    nearby crosswalks, trash cans, and motion-censored pedestrian-scale lighting. Where feasible, bus
    stops should include paved bus pullouts to reduce delay to traffic, bike parking, wayfinding signage,
    benches, a shelter, and route information. These amenities will make the transit experience more
    comfortable for all users.
8. Regional Transit Expansion: Work with regional partners to expand transit service between
    Nederland and neighboring jurisdictions. This includes coordination with Boulder County on the
    planned mountain driver program, educational resources about available public transportation
    and paratransit options, and increased coverage and frequency of transit to Boulder, Ward, and
    Rollinsville.
9. Intra-Nederland Circulation: Continue to collaborate with existing regional shuttles, such as
    the shuttle to the Hessie Trailhead, that provides additional connections to the town. Through
    collaborative efforts, Nederland can leverage shared costs and resources to provide transit within
    the town. A circulator should also be considered on peak demand days that provides convenient
    access to parking lots and other key destinations within town.


```
Transportation 71
```
5

10. Updated Maintenance Plan: The proposed enhanced roadway, bicycle, and pedestrian infrastructure
    as recommended in this plan will require increased investment in maintenance. To support this new
    infrastructure, consider creating a pavement and street sweeping plan, in addition to the town’s
    existing snow plowing plan, to maintain walking/rolling, biking, and driving as reliable transportation
    options year-round. The snow plowing plan should be reevaluated with an eye to prioritizing
    maintenance of pedestrian facilities and access to transit.
11. Parking Demand Management Strategies (Short-term): Implement parking demand strategies
    including expansion of paid parking, expansion and greater enforcement of time-restricted parking,
    expansion of shared parking, improvement of wayfinding around parking lots, and data collection and
    monitoring of parking supply during peak demand days/times.
12. Expansion of Parking Supply (Long-term): Continue to monitor parking demand in the future
    following the implementation of short-term parking demand management strategies, as identified in
    this chapter. If data shows a growth in parking demand, causing parking to begin to reach capacity
    even with the short-term recommendations in place, the town may want to consider expanding
    parking supply. The decision to add capacity should not be based entirely on demand but should also
    be a value-based decision among the community.

## Introduction

This chapter summarizes key information related to health, human, and social services in the Town
of Nederland. This chapter includes key information about the service offerings Nederland residents
have in town, as well as in Boulder County. It provides an overview of previous, somewhat limited
planning and policy work concerning health, human, and social services and identifies key stakeholders
and service providers within the community. This chapter goes on to highlight key takeaways from
community and stakeholder engagement regarding service offerings and gaps, and concludes with
objectives, strategies, and actions for the Town of Nederland to consider.

## Existing Conditions

The Town of Nederland and surrounding Boulder County, and Peak-to-Peak neighboring communities
have a variety of community, health, and human resources available to area residents. Further,
Nederland supports local community well-being by funding the Nederland Health and Human Services
Fund through the Lodging Occupation Tax recently enacted in 2023. Several of the community
resources and service providers are outlined in greater detail below. Generally, the Town of Nederland
is well served by an extensive network of resource and social service providers and should continue to
promote these services to residents, as well as leverage partnerships between service providers and the
Town of Nederland where appropriate.

**SOCIAL SERVICES**

**_NEDERLAND FOOD PANTRY, COMMUNITY GARDENS
& CLOTHING CLOSET_**

The Nederland Food Pantry works to relieve hunger and provide basic needs that support the Peak-
to-Peak Community by offering a food pantry and clothing closet to those in need. The Food Pantry
also helps host a Human Services Fair each fourth Thursday of the month from 10 am to noon in the
Community Center. At the fair, attendees can meet representatives from Boulder County Health and
Human Services, sign up for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and other services,
get personal finance advice, and meet with other key partners like EFAA, Canyon Cares, the Area
Agency on Aging, and Mental Health Partners.

**_EMERGENCY FAMILY ASSISTANCE ASSOCIATION_**

The Emergency Family Assistance Association (EFAA) provides stabilizing services, innovative programs,
and transformative advocacy to strengthen families and create a thriving community where families
can get out of poverty. They offer a food bank (in North Boulder), financial assistance, and operate 60
housing units across Boulder County, including a 10-unit property in Nederland purchased in January of

2023. EFAA also manages cases, helps connect clients to various peer organizations and resources, and
provides education about financial resources and products. While based in Boulder, EFAA has a strong
presence in the County’s rural communities outside of the City of Boulder and provides equivalent
services to residents in outlying areas of Boulder County.

**_CANYON CARES_**

Canyon Cares is a non-profit organization providing short-term financial assistance to help care for
the necessities and urgent needs of neighbors. Their service area includes the southern portion of the
Peak-to-Peak region, including Nederland, Rollinsville, Ward, and Black Hawk. Assistance awards can go
towards categories such as housing, utilities, transportation, medical costs, education, and food.

assistance to Boulder County residents with healthcare matters relating to chronic pain and/or opioid
and other substance use disorders. The program provides short-term case management services and
referrals to community agencies for those seeking treatment in an outpatient setting or through higher
levels of care. The PILLAR Program is funded by the City of Boulder’s Health Equity Fund and Substance
Education & Awareness Fund and is housed in Boulder at the Center for Mind-Body Medicine.
```
**TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS**

```
BOULDER COUNTY MOBILITY FOR ALL
The goal of the Mobility for All (M4A) Program is to promote accessible, affordable, and equitable
multimodal (transit, bike, etc.) transportation options for residents of all ages and abilities and to
raise awareness on transportation challenges. The program is currently undergoing efforts to create
a mountain volunteer driver program called “Peak Ride.” Peak Ride would be aimed at empowering
seniors, people with disabilities, and caregivers living in mountain communities in Boulder County. The
Peak Ride planning process created a working group made up of community partners, older adults,
people with disabilities, and caregivers to guide the planning process. The working group met monthly in
Nederland, Allenspark, Jamestown, Ward, Lyons, and Gold Hill to develop the framework of a volunteer
driver program, which is still under process.

## ENGAGEMENT SUMMARY

**WHAT WAS HEARD**

From the combined survey and Open House results, when asked which service categories the Town
should focus on providing, the most common answers were childcare, affordable housing support, and
eldercare. When asked which services people must travel outside Nederland for, the main responses
were pharmacy, urgent/emergency care, childcare, pre-school, physical therapy, exercise classes, and
primary care.

These responses indicated a need for certain health and human services in Nederland, “but that is
understandable” as one respondent wrote on the board, for some of these services to be missing given
the size of the town. Pharmacy, daycare, and eldercare emerged as the most feasible primary needs/
desires that could be supported in town.

**_STAKEHOLDER MEETING - NEEDS AND OPPORTUNITIES_**

Three main needs emerged from conversations with the Peak-to-Peak Housing and Human Services
Alliance. Those needs were related to transportation, creating a human services hub for nonprofits
to operate from, and increasing funding opportunities. Several member organizations present at the
meeting agreed that transportation, including after-school transportation for kids, and getting from
Ward to Nederland to Boulder without a car is a challenge. Those who are most in need of human
services often do not have a car or the ability to drive, and due to the mountainous terrain and lack of
transportation options in the Peak-to-Peak Region, accessible transportation remains a barrier to serving
the community. On this point, some present at the meeting pointed out that Boulder Valley School
District (BVSD) could become a partner in helping students get from school to after-school sports,
services, and opportunities. The Mountain Rides program has been successful at starting to address this
problem and is a well-utilized program.

Another primary desire the Alliance identified was having a human and social services hub for nonprofit
organizations to operate from and collaborate. A lot of outreach events are currently operated from the
Community Center, which has been effective given the central location, so the space would primarily be
an office for internal operation.

This group of stakeholders also emphasized that funding is a challenge for maintaining and expanding
operations. Several of the social service offerings in the Nederland area rely on donations, grants, and
volunteerism. New ways of increasing revenue for key services would be advantageous.

Other specific ideas came up in the conversation, such as identifying gaps in service including a lack of
dental and medical services, harm reduction and substance abuse programs, and in-home care and aging-
in-place opportunities.

Finally, the Alliance emphasized that continued workforce housing availability remains a problem and
impacts social and human services professionals who struggle to afford to live in the community. For
example, providing better child and elder care, as well as having more medical services, would require
better workforce housing availability.


**78 Comprehensive Plan** 2024 **Update**

## Vision Statement

```
“All Peak-to-Peak community residents have accessible and affordable
healthcare, childcare, and human services, supported by a unified nonprofit
network. The Town of Nederland plays a central role in convening and
organizing the efforts of the region’s non-profit organizations and helping to
educate residents on the services available to them.”
```
## Objectives & Strategies

```
OBJECTIVE 1:
Create new opportunities to connect residents with local service
providers
```
```
Through feedback collected for this comprehensive plan update, members
of the community and key stakeholders described a need for more opportunities to connect service
providers with residents beyond periodic tabling events at the Community Center. The Town of
Nederland and Boulder County have an extensive network of service providers, and residents have
expressed interest in understanding the resources available to them. The town could explore increasing
the frequency of tabling events or providing more dedicated space for service providers to communicate
and connect with Nederland residents.
```
```
OBJECTIVE 2:
Ensure Community Design supports people of all ages,
incomes and abilities
```
```
Livable communities support the thriving of people at all life stages,
incomes, and abilities in their daily navigation of their community. AARP provides an easy-to-understand
definition of a livable community, “one that is just as comfortable for an 80-year-old as an 8-year-old”.^1
The Town of Nederland should prioritize accessibility, and inclusion in community design and in land use
and building regulations to ensure that residents are able to remain in Nederland and be well-supported
by their community.

**STRATEGIES**

1. Amend Use Categories in Land Use Code to Support In-Home Service Providers: Engagement
    feedback with community members, and key stakeholders working in health and human services
    in the community have outlined the lack of available services such as childcare, physical therapy,
    and home health services. These services can be done in a mobile “on-call setting”, or licensed
    practitioners or qualified service providers could be able to perform these services from their
    homes or accessory structures on their properties. As the Housing and Economic Development
    chapters have outlined, there are opportunities to reduce the regulatory barriers to allowing home
    health or childcare services in the use tables of Nederland’s Land Development Code.
2. Complete a Boomer Bond Assessment: Like many communities, and the State of Colorado as a
    whole, the population of Nederland is getting older and adults over the age of 65 are forecasted
    to continue to be a growing share of the population over time. The Town of Nederland is in the
    Boulder County Area Agency on Aging (AAA) service area. The Boulder County AAA provides
    funding, advocacy, and services for older adults, people with disabilities, veterans, and refugees
    in Boulder County. The Boulder County AAA is distinct from the Denver Regional Council
    of Governments (DRCOG) Area Agency on Aging. While not included in the DRCOG AAA,
    Nederland is a DRCOG member government and eligible to take advantage of DRCOG provided
    services and technical assistance. One such technical assistance tool offered by DRCOG is the
    Boomer Bond Community Assessment tool. The purpose of the Boomer Bond Assessment Tool
    is to help local governments and associated organizations evaluate their existing resources, plans,
    regulations, programs and community design to understand how their community serves older
    adult residents. After completing the assessment, local government staff and elected officials will
    have a comprehensive community assessment to guide decisions related to building a community
    that supports healthy aging. The assessment tool is designed to examine current circumstances and
    existing resources; understand community strengths and deficiencies; identify short- and long-term
    priorities; and confidently implement strategies that contribute to healthy, successful aging. The
    assessment can be completed as a self-assessment, or The town can work with DRCOG staff to
    complete the assessment.
3. Create a Nederland Human and Social Services Hub: Explore more permanent space for health,
    human, and social service providers to “set up shop” to reach community residents. Currently,
    outreach events are held in a non-permanent manner at the Nederland Community Center. While
    this is an effective way to reach folks, this method relies on people being available to attend these
    outreach events, knowing that the events are happening, and being at a convenient time. The
    creation of “hub” does not need to involve setting aside new space, it could look like allowing for
    outreach events to happen on a reoccurring basis once a week out of the Community Center, or
    it could look like providing an “ information desk” in the Nederland Town Hall or Community
    center where residents can access information and learn about all of the service providers that are
    operating in Nederland and surrounding counties and provide a way to get in contact with service
    providers in the area.
4. Build Upon Transportation Connections: During the stakeholder feedback process, several
    stakeholders identified a need for more multimodal transportation connections to serve school
    kids and folks working in Nederland but employed outside of town. The Mountain Rides Program
    is already a great resource and is working to fulfill this need, however, future partnerships with the
    Boulder Valley School District could be pursued. Additionally, the Town of Nederland is working
    to complete a Multimodal Transportation Plan which outlines specific recommendations to improve
    the ability of people of all ages, incomes, and abilities to navigate Nederland and their daily lives
    effectively and sustainably.

## Introduction

This chapter summarizes key information related to utilities and water resources in the Town of
Nederland. This chapter includes information from the Department of Local Affairs’ Grow Water Smart
Self-Assessment. The water resources portion of the chapter considers the supply and demand for
water, matters of water resiliency, and how growth can align with Nederland’s water availability. This
chapter also includes a brief overview of existing utilities in the town and includes objectives and actions
for the effective and sustainable delivery of utilities. Transition to renewable energy, electric vehicle
fleets, and zero waste programs are core concepts in this chapter, underscoring a commitment to the
sustainable delivery of utilities and services.

## Existing Conditions & Key Issues

**WATER RESOURCES**

The Town of Nederland draws its water supply from Middle Boulder Creek and treats it at a facility
adjacent to Nederland Middle-High School. The intake location sits on Arapahoe Ranch, across the
street from the high school and the treatment plant. The town’s source watershed sits on National
Forest System lands and is at risk of upstream wildfire impacts. In the event of a fire, the water intake
location has a small holding pond that can hold about 1-2 days’ worth of water. However, if Middle
Boulder Creek was ever contaminated by wildfire debris or other contaminants, the town may not be
able to draw water from the creek and the pond could deplete rapidly.

Barring a wildfire or other contaminating event, the water supply is relatively secure in Nederland,
with rights and an augmentation plan allowing the town to draw raw water year-round from Middle
Boulder Creek. The town also owns 100-acre feet of conditional water rights for an unbuilt “Nederland
Reservoir” on Middle Boulder Creek. These rights must be reviewed every six years in Water Court for
a finding of reasonable diligence in building such infrastructure. The conditional right allows the town to
pursue storage of additional water at or upstream of the treatment plant intake. Finally, Nederland has
an agreement with the City of Boulder to store up to 39.6 acre-feet of its senior water right in Barker
Reservoir, downstream from the town and the wastewater treatment plant. The town is currently
negotiating with the City of Boulder to extend the agreement beyond the 2026 expiration.

The town completed the Colorado “Growing Water Smart” self-assessment, which found that the
existing water supply and demand are balanced and projected to remain balanced over the next 25 years
with current rates of growth. The current usage is 157.8 acre-feet/year and is projected to rise to 224
acre-feet/year by 2030. Per capita, the current usage is 97-111 gallons/day, which is within, but slightly
above, the range of normal water per capita water usage in the US of 80-100 gallons per day, according
to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Water Stats.

Current water efficiency measures in Nederland include water metering, rate structuring, and the town
water conservation program (13-71 in town Code). However, the town currently partners with Partner
for A Clean Environment (PACE), which provides rebates and incentives to consumers for water
conservation, such as water-efficient appliances and outdoor irrigation evaluations.

Finally, new developments in Nederland are currently required to demonstrate physical and legal water
adequacy and availability during the final development approval process. Development standards in
Nederland are sensitive to water quality protection by limiting urban sprawl, requiring stream setbacks,
requiring vegetation and soil erosion protections, imposing stormwater management standards, and
promoting density.


**82 Comprehensive Plan** 2024 **Update**

```
UTILITIES
The Town of Nederland provides water and wastewater management services on the municipal
level. Electricity is provided by Excel and internet service is provided by private companies, including
Nedernet, a local service provider.
```
```
WATER AND SEWER
In 2011, Nederland invested in a state-of-the-art water treatment facility designed to meet the current
and near-future needs of the community. The facility was built to accommodate the town’s projected
growth, but capacity limitations are already being considered as the community expands. The town
carefully monitors water demand and the facility is below its firm capacity of .2 MG, which is the facility’s
maximum water production if one of the two filtration units is out of service. The Town expects to go
beyond this firm capacity sometime in the next 10 years. If development and population growth cause
the wastewater system to exceed 80% capacity, Nederland will be legally required to start planning for
system expansions. Once the system reaches 90% capacity, the town will need to begin to construct
expanded water infrastructure to accommodate the increased demand. However, if current growth
patterns continue the wastewater plant is projected to stay below the 80% planning threshold for the
next 10 years, unless unexpectedly large development/redevelopment occurs.
```
```
BROADBAND INTERNET
In 2024, Nederland took a significant step forward in improving its broadband infrastructure by securing
a Capital Project Fund grant of $8,667,692 from the Colorado Broadband Office. This funding, in
collaboration with Maverix Broadband, Inc., will extend high-speed fiber optic internet service to 2,725
previously unserved or underserved addresses in Nederland, Gilpin County, and parts of unincorporated
Boulder County. This project aims to address the digital divide, providing reliable, high-speed internet
access to households and businesses that have struggled with connectivity in the past. Expanded internet
access is expected to support economic growth, improve access to telehealth, and enhance the overall
quality of life for residents.
```
```
RECYCLING AND COMPOSTING
During community engagement, residents identified recycling and compositing as the second highest
sustainability/resilience priority, second only to water resilience. Nederland residents currently have
service options for waste removal, recycling, and composting, which can all be dropped off for a small
fee at the Nederland Transfer Station and Recycling Drop-off. The Transfer Station is operated by
Boulder County and materials left there are eventually brought to landfills and compost/recycling
centers elsewhere in the county. There are also private pick-up services residents can pay for to
avoid transporting their waste to the Transfer Station. While service options for all waste types exist,
residents must take responsibility for engaging in recycling and composting in the home and understand
what can and cannot be recycled or composted.
```
```
RENEWABLE ENERGY GOALS
The Utilities Department at the Town of Nederland has identified aspirational renewable energy goals
for town fleets and utilities. Over time, the Town would like to transition to an all-electric fleet for
town-owned vehicles as well as move towards the use of renewable energy in utility service production
and delivery.
```

## Vision Statement

```
Water and utility systems meet the social, economic, and environmental
needs of the community through resilient practices. We prioritize the
protection of water resources, equitable access to high-quality utilities, and
proactive planning to address future growth and environmental challenges.
Our approach ensures that utility systems support the health, well-being,
and sustainability of all residents while respecting the character and values
of our community.
```
## Objectives & Strategies

OBJECTIVE 1:
**Strengthen the resilience of the water system and
protect existing water rights.**

The Town of Nederland will take proactive measures to protect
its water system from potential disruptions, particularly in response to risks such as wildfires near
water intake locations. A feasibility study for “Nederland Reservoir” is already complete and could be
further pursued to help Nederland secure water rights and expand its water storage capacity. The town
should continue securing extensions for existing water storage agreements with the City of Boulder
for Barker Reservoir. Nederland will also aim to enhance its water conservation programs, promoting
efficiency measures such as rebates for water-efficient appliances and landscaping. The town has not
implemented but could consider the following water conservation measures in the future: cash for grass/
turf replacement, rebates for water-efficient fixtures and appliances, water-efficient product giveaways,
water-efficient building code requirements, conservation education for consumers, landscaping
education for property owners and landscaping professionals, water efficiency rebates, or water audits.
Additionally, the town will continue to monitor and secure its legal water rights to ensure a sustainable
supply for future growth and changing environmental conditions.

OBJECTIVE 2:
**Provide high-quality public utility services to all Nederland
residents.**

Nederland will ensure that public utilities, including water, sewer, and
electricity, are delivered efficiently and equitably to all residents. The town will assess the need for water
system expansion as growth occurs, taking steps to address capacity requirements when thresholds are
reached. Coordination with private utility providers should be prioritized through an annual meeting
to align infrastructure projects and reduce disruptions. Nederland will also explore opportunities to
regionalize utility services in underserved areas, ensuring that all parts of the community have access to
essential utilities.

programs, aiming for a cradle-to-cradle zero-waste system.
```
```
Nederland will continue taking steps towards its zero-waste management system goals by
enhancing existing recycling and composting efforts. In collaboration with Boulder County and local
organizations, the town could explore partnerships to manage composting infrastructure, ensuring the
right mix of organic materials is collected and processed. Public outreach programs will encourage waste
reduction in homes, schools, and businesses while addressing cross-contamination issues. The town
will also continue to support local recycling initiatives and consider policies to reduce overall waste
generated by public and private entities.
```
```
OBJECTIVE 4:
Promote the transition to renewable energy sources and electric fleets for the
town.
```
```
Nederland will begin to take steps towards its renewable energy goals by investing in solar
and wind energy projects and converting town-owned vehicle fleets to electric vehicles. The town will
seek grant funding and partnerships to accelerate the deployment of renewable energy infrastructure
and ensure that public buildings and facilities are powered by clean energy. Additionally, Nederland
will work with residents and businesses to promote energy efficiency upgrades and renewable energy
installations, aiming for long-term reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil
fuels.

**STRATEGIES**

1. Implement Water System Resilience Improvements: Assess the vulnerability of the current water
    system to wildfire and natural disasters. Use this information to identify specific actions and
    improvements that would increase emergency storage capacity options. Develop and implement
    infrastructure improvements to protect Nederland’s water intake system from wildfire-related debris
    and other upstream hazards (constructing barriers, upgrading filtration systems, backup water storage,
    etc.). Help secure long-term water storage by developing a new reservoir on Middle Boulder Creek to
    secure Nederland’s conditional water storage rights.
2. Monitor Water Rights and Legal Compliance: Regularly review and update water rights agreements and
    ensure compliance with the augmentation plan to maintain water security. Continue negotiations with
    the City of Boulder to extend the storage agreement for Nederland’s senior water rights in Barker
    Reservoir. The current Barker Meadow Reservoir agreement with the City of Boulder expires in 2026.
3. Expand Water Conservation Programs: Implement water conservation measures such as efficient
    appliance rebates, cash for grass/turf replacement, landscaping education, water efficiency rebates, and
    community education. Promote the adoption of water-efficient practices throughout the town.
4. Annual Utility Coordination Meetings: Establish annual meetings between the town and private utility
    providers to align infrastructure projects, reduce disruptions, notify of projects that may impact the
    availability of services, and ensure efficient service delivery. Look for opportunities to coordinate on
    upcoming projects to promote a ‘dig once’ approach to project completion that achieves multiple goals
    with minimal construction.
5. Regional Utility Service Feasibility Study: Explore the feasibility of extending water and sewer services
    to underserved areas within Nederland, including costs, funding sources, and potential partnership
    opportunities.
6. Maintain Impact Fees for New Developments: Ensure that new development contributes to the cost
    of providing utilities by implementing and maintaining impact fees and other financial tools. Consider
    the impact of new development on utility systems including factors like population generated, public
    service costs, and projected revenue from the project.
7. Improve Utility Service Lines: Inspect water mains, service lines, and interior water lines to make sure
    they are well-maintained, properly installed, and insulated to reduce winter water line bleeding.
8. Partner with Boulder County for Composting: Explore partnerships with Boulder County and regional
    agencies to develop a composting program, including options for contracting with private composting
    facilities.
9. Engage the Community in Waste Reduction: Organize community-wide programs to promote waste
    reduction and participation in recycling and composting efforts, including partnerships with local
    businesses and organizations. Implement strategies to reduce contamination in recycling and compost
    streams, including community education, monitoring programs, and penalties for improper waste
    disposal.
10. Electric Fleet Transition Strategy: Create a strategy to replace town-owned vehicles with electric
    alternatives, focusing on securing grants for fleet replacement and developing charging infrastructure.
11. Community Renewable Energy Incentive Program: Offer incentives or educate on available rebates to
    residents and businesses to encourage the adoption of renewable energy technologies, such as solar
    panel installations, energy-efficient appliances, and electric vehicle charging stations.
12. Engage with Utility Providers for Renewable Integration: Work with Excel Energy to expand the
    integration of renewable energy into the local grid, including community solar projects and energy
    storage solutions.

## Introduction

This chapter takes into account the naturally occurring resources and hazards surrounding Nederland.
On the one hand, Nederland’s position in a high-alpine environment blesses it with outstanding scenery
and the opportunity to preserve important natural habitats and ecosystems. On the other hand, the
dynamic nature of the surroundings leaves Nederland vulnerable to certain hazards such as wildfire
and flooding. This chapter charts a path forward for stewarding the natural landscape and building
the resilience to handle its natural hazards. In summary, this chapter is about living in harmony with
the natural landscape. The concepts in this chapter were developed through conversations with
stakeholders about the needs of the community and an analysis of existing resources and exposure
to potential hazards. It takes into account a basic understanding of hazard risk exposure, habitat
significance, and the future impacts of climate change. This chapter includes actionable policies to
advance Nederland’s environmental resilience and are intended to keep Nederland and the surrounding
environment safe and resilient.

## Existing Conditions & Key Issues

**NATURAL RESOURCES**

**_HABITAT, BIODIVERSITY, AND ECOLOGY_**

The natural environment surrounding Nederland consists primarily of Rocky Mountain Ponderosa Pine
Woodland and Lodgepole Pine Forests. Lodgepole pine forests, common at higher elevations, are fire-
dependent ecosystems, while Ponderosa Pine woodlands, found at lower elevations, host several rare
plant species. These forests, along with the wetlands and areas of high biodiversity near Nederland, are
crucial to the region’s ecological health.

Surrounding Nederland are several designated wetlands and areas of high or very high biodiversity
significance as identified by the Colorado Conservation Data Explorer (CODEX) drawing on data from
Colorado Parks and Wildlife and the US Fish and Wildlife Service. In addition, there are several elk
migration corridors on the outskirts of town. It is important to avoid disrupting these key parts of the
natural landscape by discouraging development or growth in these locations.

Middle Boulder Creek and North Beaver Creek, the two riparian zones intersecting Nederland,
provide valuable wetland habitat. These habitats are both ecologically productive and valuable while also
providing the town with excellent natural and scenic amenities.

The town’s 2016 Riparian & Wetland Habitat Assessment by Western Ecological Resource, Inc.
emphasized the need to minimize impacts on wetlands, particularly the fragile Fen Wetland northeast
of the Boulder Creek Lodge (previously Magnuson Hotel). Recommendations include avoiding
development in sensitive areas, encouraging the planting of native species, and removing invasive weeds.
Additionally, the assessment suggests restoring floodplains, stabilizing creek banks, and enhancing public
awareness through educational signage. The specific recommendations of this study can be seen in
Figure 8.1.

While these recommendations provide a framework for stewardship, the overarching goal is to balance
human use with the preservation of these natural resources, ensuring they remain vital and healthy for
future generations.


**88 Comprehensive Plan** 2024 **Update**

**CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS**

```
CLIMATE CHANGE
In a business-as-usual scenario, by the year 2050, Boulder County can expect to see warmer
temperatures and, while potentially slightly more total precipitation, more dry days on average. The
starkest climate shift in Boulder County will be temperature, with the annual average daily maximum
temperature rising from 56.8 (1961-1990 observed average) to 63 degrees Fahrenheit (Livneh et al.,
2015). Generally, the future is expected to have wetter springs and drier falls, a pattern that typically
increases the chances of wildfire and contributed to the Boulder County Marshall Fire in 2021 (Scott,
2022). According to the CU Boulder Center for Sustainable Landscapes and Communities in 2020,
“Climate change is known to increase uncertainty when it comes to weather expectations - a trend
we are seeing in Boulder County. Thirty years of precipitation data show that dry years are getting
drier, wet years are getting wetter, and drought and flood events are becoming increasingly difficult to
predict.”
```
```
Besides increasing heat, Boulder County is expecting impacts from climate change including increased
frequency and intensity of flooding, longer periods of drought, more wildfires, more frequent beetle
infestations, and water shortages. Wildfires are already burning twice as many acres each year as
compared to 1980. Colorado’s precipitation is 20% lower than it was in the last century, and decreasing
snowpack makes it harder to keep water resources in the county during increasingly hot summers
(Boulder County, 2023).
```
```
The impacts of climate change can cost human health, well-being, and safety as well as the economic
productivity of important industries; especially skiing and agriculture in Boulder County. The awareness
of the impacts of climate change and increasing uncertainty around environmental hazards is a core
reason resilience is the framework of this plan and the driving value for Nederland’s future.

FIGURE 8.2 8

**NATURAL RESOURCES MAP**


**90 Comprehensive Plan** 2024 **Update**

```
WILDFIRE
Wildfire is a significant threat to the Town of Nederland, which is located entirely within the Wildland
Urban Interface (WUI), an area at high risk of wildfires. The 2011 Community Wildfire Protection Plan
(CWPP) identified Nederland’s surrounding ecosystems as highly flammable due to typical montane and
upper montane fuels, combined with factors like weather and topography. The short fire season and the
risk of fires spreading uphill increase the vulnerability of neighborhoods situated on higher slopes.
```
```
According to the CWPP, all areas of Nederland have high to extreme wildfire hazard ratings. The town
is served by the Nederland Fire Protection District, which operates three fire stations equipped with
various fire engines and water tenders. While the CWPP commends the Fire Protection District for its
strong firefighter training, it also suggests further training and equipment enhancements.
```
```
FLOOD
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provides hydraulic modeling studies for
communities across the US, which are aggregated into the National Flood Hazard Layer. These models
help support the National Flood Insurance Program and can help individual developers and communities
understand their type of flooding risk.
```
```
According to the most recent FEMA flood model for Nederland, completed in 2012, some parts of
Nederland are within the 0.2% and 1% annual chance floodplain of Middle Boulder Creek and North
Beaver Creek. However, their model shows these floodplains do not generally deviate far from the
stream channel. This indicates that floods are likely to stay close to the stream banks, and the area
of the floodplain is relatively small. Downtown Nederland is the most impacted by potential flooding,
and the risk is most pronounced for the properties around North Beaver Creek, where there are 26
structures currently in the flood plain (Figure 8.3).
```
```
EVACUATION CAPACITY
In 2023, the Town of Nederland commissioned The Ember Alliance to model potential evacuation times
and roadway congestion for the Nederland and Timberline Fire Protection Districts (FPDs).
```
```
The four modeled scenarios concluded that evacuating residents during a wildfire in the FPDs could take
between 2.25 and 3.75 hours. The roads with the highest potential for extreme congestion were the
following:
```
- Highway 72 (Peak to Peak Highway, West 2nd Street, and Coal Creek Canyon Road)
- Highway 119 (Boulder Canyon Drive and North Bridge Street)
- County Road 122 (Sugarloaf Road)
- Eldora Road
- Magnolia Drive
The following three locations were identified as locations that could experience substantial roadside
hazards during a wildfire and may benefit from alternate egress routes:
- The area around Eldora Mountain
- Lazy Z Neighborhood
- Big Springs Neighborhood

**92 Comprehensive Plan** 2024 **Update**

## Vision Statement

```
Nederland is a model community for environmental sustainability and
resilience. Our community is knowledgeable about how our everyday
decisions impact the earth, and our city makes sustainable development
decisions driven by the efficient use of land. We are proactive in our
approach to mitigate and adapt to the adverse effects of climate change.
We are dedicated to conserving, preserving, protecting, and restoring our
environment to foster a sustainable future that leads to social and economic
improvements in our community.
```
## Objectives & Strategies

```
1
```
```
OBJECTIVE 1:
Ensure Water Resource Resilience and Long-term Sufficiency
```
```
A wildfire in the upper Central Boulder Creek watershed poses a significant
risk to Nederland’s water supply, potentially compromising access to clean
water. To address this priority, Nederland will prioritize the development of infrastructure that
mitigates this risk, such as enhancing water intake protection and securing additional water storage
options. This objective overlaps with Objective 1 in the Utilities, Facilities, and Water Resources
chapter. More specific strategies and actions are available in that chapter.
```
```
OBJECTIVE 2:
Protect and Enhance Ecological Health and Biodiversity
```
```
Ecological health and biodiversity are very important to the community; biodiversity
provides ecosystem services, resilience to environmental changes, improved quality of life,
and upholds the inherent rights of nature. Nederland will focus on preserving and restoring critical
habitats, wetlands, and other areas of high biodiversity significance. Furthermore, the town will minimize
human impacts on ecological areas to enhance natural processes and avoid human interference to the
greatest extent possible. Strategic development restrictions and habitat restoration projects will drive
the ecological health of the town, with a special focus on protecting and restoring wetlands and the
Central Boulder Creek corridor.
```
```
Connection to Resilience: Infrastructure and Ecosystems
```
```
1 Objective 6 of the Land Use Chapter services many of these objectives through climate-smart land use policies
that prevent growth in sensitive or hazardous areas. A driving goal of the land use chapter is also the promotion of compact
sustainable growth patterns that help reduce Nederland’s environmental impact/urban footprint.
```

```
Natural Resources & Hazards 93
```

OBJECTIVE 3:
**Enhance Wildfire Preparedness and Mitigation**

Nederland will strengthen its wildfire preparedness and mitigation efforts by
adopting fire-resistant building codes, enhancing fuel reduction programs, and
updating the Community Wildfire Protection Plan (CWPP). The town will collaborate
with local fire protection districts to conduct regular community education, evacuation drills, and
training to ensure residents are equipped to respond effectively in the event of a wildfire. Additionally,
Nederland will prioritize identifying and implementing defensible space initiatives around critical
infrastructure and residential areas to reduce wildfire risk and protect lives and property.

OBJECTIVE 4:
**Reduce Flood Risk and Enhance Flood Resilience**

Nederland will proactively reduce flood risk by enforcing stringent
development controls in flood-prone areas, upgrading stormwater
management systems, and promoting natural flood mitigation measures such as wetland preservation,
riparian buffer restoration, and integrating green infrastructure into town projects. The town will also
collaborate with regional and federal agencies to update floodplain maps and enhance flood forecasting
and warning systems. These actions will help protect people, property, and infrastructure from flood
hazards while enhancing the town’s overall flood resilience.

OBJECTIVE 5:
**Improve Emergency Evacuation, Preparedness, and
Response Capacity**

Nederland will enhance its emergency evacuation and response
capacity by improving key evacuation routes, developing alternative egress options, and addressing
potential roadside hazards identified in recent evacuation models. The town will also strengthen its
emergency communication systems to ensure timely and effective dissemination of information during
crises. Regular community drills and training will be conducted to prepare residents and first responders
for a range of emergency scenarios, ensuring a coordinated and efficient response in the event of an
evacuation.

3. Riparian Buffer and Wetland Restoration: Restore and preserve riparian buffers and wetlands
    as natural flood mitigation measures. Focus on areas along Middle Boulder Creek and North
    Beaver Creek, integrating these efforts with broader habitat restoration projects. Refer to the
    recommendations from the town’s 2016 Riparian & Wetland Habitat Assessment to identify priority
    projects for habitat restoration while balancing the enjoyment of recreational trails.
4. Wetland Protection Ordinance: Develop and adopt a wetland protection ordinance that restricts
    development in and around designated wetlands and biodiversity hotspots. The ordinance should
    include guidelines for buffer zones, development setbacks, and penalties for non-compliance.
5. Educational Signage and Public Awareness: Install educational signage around key ecological areas
    to raise public awareness of the importance of preserving these environments. These signs should
    highlight local biodiversity, the role of wetlands in flood mitigation, and actions the public can take to
    support conservation efforts.

6. Fire-resistant Building Code: Update and enforce fire-resistant building codes, particularly in
    high-risk zones (such as Mountain Residential). These codes should include requirements for fire-
    resistant materials, defensible space, vegetation management, and other fire mitigation measures.
7. CWPP Revision and Implementation: A new CWPP plan is currently in the process of being
    updated. The town will continue to coordinate with the Nederland Fire Protection District to
    ensure the new CWPP reflects the current risks and best practices and provides a clear action plan
    to address the needs of the community. The town will coordinate with NFPD to work on high-
    priority recommended projects such as fuel reduction and fire break projects.
8. Stormwater Management System Upgrades: Upgrade Nederland’s stormwater management systems
    to handle increased runoff and reduce flood risk. This includes installing green infrastructure, such as
    permeable pavements and rain gardens, and improving drainage capacity in flood-prone areas.
9. Floodplain Development Controls: Restrict development in flood-prone areas by continuing to
    enforce strict development controls within floodplains, ensuring that new construction adheres
    to flood-resistant standards. Collaborate with FEMA and Boulder County to update and expand
    floodplain maps.
10. Emergency Communication System Enhancements: Strengthen and regularly test emergency
    communication systems to ensure timely and effective dissemination of information during crises.
    This includes updating communication technologies and ensuring redundancy in communication
    channels. Under emergency management conditions, continue to work with the Boulder County
    Sheriff’s Department Emergency Communications Center, the Nederland Fire Protection District,
    and the State Forest Service to improve the reliability and adequacy of emergency communications,
    preparedness, and notification to the public within the Nederland area.
11. Second Bridge for Egress and Evacuation: Plan and construct a second bridge to serve as an
    additional egress and evacuation route. This infrastructure project will enhance community
    resilience by providing alternative access during emergencies.
12. Hazard Mitigation and Evacuation Preparedness Education: Provide educational materials to
    residents (especially new residents) about evacuation procedures. Develop and implement an
    educational program to inform residents and property owners about best practices for reducing
    wildfire hazard exposure and vulnerability. The program will focus on:

```
a. Building Materials and Construction: Providing guidance on using fire-resistant materials and
construction techniques, including non-combustible roof assemblies, eaves, vents, gutters,
exterior walls, windows, and surface coverings, to improve the resilience of homes and buildings.
b. Vegetation Management: Offering resources and advice on effective vegetation management, such
as tree thinning, spacing, limbing, and trimming, the removal of ladder fuels, surface vegetation
clearance, and brush management. Encourage the adoption of vegetation conversion and fuel
modification techniques to create defensible spaces around properties.

## Introduction

This chapter covers key information related to economic development, arts, and culture in the Town
of Nederland. The combination of Nederland’s spectacular scenery and its reputation as a quirky town
with a thriving arts and music scene make it a popular day-trip destination for residents of the Front
Range. As a result, the economy of Nederland is strongly linked to arts, culture, events, and tourism.
Finding the right balance of visitor-oriented and local-oriented businesses, services, and goods that are
offered is critical to the town’s success. This chapter summarizes background information on the state
of the economy and key arts and culture offerings in Nederland. Further, this chapter identifies key
objectives and strategies that the town may consider for diversifying the local economy and continuing
to foster an environment that is friendly to unique arts and cultural opportunities and events.

## Existing Conditions & Key Issues

**ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT**

**_TOWN BUDGET AND FISCAL HEALTH_**

The 2022 Nederland financial report showed the Town of Nederland in good financial standing.
In 2022, all tax revenue was up 6.9% compared to fiscal year 2021. As of December 31, 2022, the
governmental funds held $2,967,060 in cash & investments and $504,356 in liabilities, meanwhile, the
town’s governmental activities fund held $5,956,862 in capital assets, a 12.5% increase; and $64,798 in
long-term liabilities, a 58.07% decrease. Service revenue has increased, and program revenue has slightly
decreased between 2021 and 2022. Overall, the town had a higher net position in 2022 than in 2021.
This is indicative of the good fiscal health of the municipality.

In 2023 and 2024, tax revenue increases leveled out and remained roughly comparable to 2022 tax
collections. Sales tax remains the highest source of on-going revenue, followed by property taxes, then
law enforcement fines and fees. In 2023 and 2024, the Town of Nederland has seen significant increases
in grant funding, 2.4 million, to the town’s fund balance providing the Town historically high available
capital budget allowance. Grants typically have specific timelines and categorical parameters around the
use of funding; however, they can be a large contribution to the town’s capital expenditure budget which
funds new services and public infrastructure. In 2023, the town was able to outlay its largest capital
expenditure amount in the last 5 years at $808,069. Continuing to find and apply for grant funding will
be an important component in the funding and planning for new public infrastructure and services.
Stakeholder feedback has revealed that Nederland has a significant amount of aging infrastructure. The
maintenance of public infrastructure is typically not eligible for federal funding or grant funding. The
town will need to continue to increase its tax revenue to keep up with existing and future maintenance
obligations associated with public infrastructure and services to serve the economic development and
overall quality of life needs of the Town.

**_EMPLOYMENT & INCOME_**

Most workers in Nederland work remotely or are employed outside of town with very few people living
and working in Nederland. As of 2021, 70.7% work in white-collar jobs, 10.6% work in blue-collar jobs,
and 18.8% work in service positions. The area median income (AMI) in Nederland is $101,944 as of
2021 ACS data.


**98 Comprehensive Plan** 2024 **Update**

```
BUSINESS ACTIVITIES
The Town of Nederland is estimated to have around 102 total businesses.^1 Most businesses, 58.6%, are
service or retail businesses and 5% of businesses are restaurants or bars.
```
```
Downtown Nederland includes key businesses such as restaurants, bars, grocery stores and food
co-ops, gift shops and retail. Some businesses missing from Nederland include health care services,
including dentists and physical therapists, as well as auto-repair businesses, printing, and shipping. During
engagement sessions most participants indicated that they want to see more businesses that can provide
daily services to reduce trips to other Front Range communities and catalyze opportunities for local
businesses to provide core services to Nederland residents.

**_TOURISM_**

The Town of Nederland was approved to participate in the Reimagine Destinations Program by the
Colorado Tourism Office in July of 2022. This program offered the town free consulting and support
in establishing leadership around tourism, as well as identifying opportunities to increase visitation and
visitor satisfaction.

One key finding from this process is that Nederland does not currently have a tourism budget, a
Chamber of Commerce, or any other entity responsible for marketing or managing tourism for the
destination. As a result of the Reimagine Destinations Program, Nederland staff recommended that the
Board of Trustees add a tourism line item to its 2023 budget.

The most popular tourism season for Nederland is summer (June through October). In 2022, visitation
was higher than in previous years, with visitors from around Colorado making up the largest share of
visitors, followed by those from Texas.

The Reimagine Destinations Program conducted a sentiment survey that was distributed in Nederland
and surrounding areas in the fall of 2022 and received 265 resident responses. Most survey respondents
agreed that tourism is important to Nederland’s economy. Most respondents identified signage and
infrastructure, particularly parking, as insufficient to meet the needs of visitors. In several open-ended
questions, residents also emphasized the need to educate visitors on the responsible and respectful use
and protection of Nederland’s natural resources.

The Reimagine program also distributed a tourism stakeholder survey in the fall of 2022 to businesses
and organizations directly contributing to the tourism industry in Nederland. The purpose of the survey
was to receive input on the economic outlook, priority concerns, and opportunity areas for tourism-
oriented businesses. The survey received 43 responses. Most respondents said that tourism is critical
to the success of their business. A priority concern was resident sentiment and attitude towards
tourism, in addition to concerns about hiring and retaining staff and the rising cost of supplies. Business
respondents felt it was important to promote local businesses and activities, build local awareness of the
value of tourism, and promote shoulder season tourism opportunities.

STRENGTHS, WEAKNESSES, OPPORTUNITIES, AND THREATS
These following strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats are informed by several conversations
with town Staff, elected officials, and stakeholders with an interest in economic development, arts and
culture, and/or Downtown development.
```
```
The strengths of Nederland’s local economy primarily pertain to its outstanding access to outdoor
recreational and scenic assets, as well as its reputation as a quirky, artsy, and charming mountain town
within proximity of Boulder and the Front Range. Businesses in Nederland have a competitive advantage,
being able to draw on traffic from visitors for a critical mass to provide locals and tourists alike with
high-quality restaurants, shops, and amenities.
```
```
The weaknesses associated with Nederland’s economic environment primarily relate to aging
infrastructure, the small population of the town, and the cost of living. Aging infrastructure and a small
population can make it difficult for certain business types, like dentists, to set up a successful business in
town due to a lack of viable space or customers.
```
```
The opportunities to improve the economic condition in Nederland have to do with internal
organizing in the business community to throw events, increase public arts and cultural offerings, and
collaborate on projects that increase the visibility and desirability of Downtown. New public and private
development could help improve Downtown infrastructure, making it more accessible and desirable for
existing and new businesses.
```
```
Economic threats for Nederland include insufficient housing stock to support a local workforce, a lack
of collaboration in the business community, and the potential for private development to change the
character of Nederland too much. Most notable is the housing availability/affordability crisis, because
without workforce housing, new and existing businesses may become infeasible. Increasingly, many
residents of Nederland work remotely or travel to larger markets, where they conduct their shopping
and access services. This dynamic could drive a disconnection from the local economy.
```
```
Table 13 provides an overview of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) of
Nederland’s existing local economy.
```
```
ARTS + CULTURE
The following are key players in programs in the arts and cultural space in Nederland today.
```
```
NEDERLAND PUBLIC ARTS COMMITTEE
The Nederland Public Art Committee is a volunteer-led committee functioning under the Nederland
Downtown Development Authority to increase the visual beautification of the Downtown Nederland
area. The mission also includes increasing awareness and appreciation of the Nederland area culture,
including natural and cultural history, the ecological environment, music making, humor, and community
eclecticism. Funds are collected and distributed for the creation and implementation of public artworks
including public murals and other three-dimensional artworks throughout town.
```
**_ARTS AND CULTURE - ORGANIZATIONS AND PROGRAMS_**

- Art at the Center uses the Community Center as a place to highlight and support Nederland’s
    image as an emerging artisan center. Beginning in 2009, Art at the Center has been an on-going
    success in town. Three times per year the Nederland Community Center and the volunteer Art
    Committee host a new Art at the Center show focusing on local artists. Nederland area artists
    are invited to participate via newspaper ads, word of mouth, and requests to local galleries.

```
After the art goes up, the Community Center organizes a reception for the community honoring
the featured artists. The art then remains on display for 3-4 months. Local artists have been very
involved and enthusiastic about submitting their work.
```
- Nederland Day of Art is a summertime day-long festival dedicated to the celebration of local art.
    Local businesses are asked to participate by helping to showcase the work of local artists. Other
    parts of the festival have previously included an arts and crafts fair and show hosted by Art at
    the Center, live demos at various galleries around town, a mural walk with the Nederland Public
    Art committee, a reception at Kaleidoscope Fine Arts, a reception at the Nederland Community
    Presbyterian Church, live music around town, and “Take and Make Art Kits” at the library.
- Backdoor Theater is a small independent and non-profit movie theater operating out of the
    Nederland Community Center. Additionally, BDT provides performance and rehearsal space
    for local schools and community theater groups and donates space to non-profits and schools
    for special movie showings. The Theater is also host to an annual independent film festival, local
    independent film showings during the Frozen Dead Guy Days festival, and special events such
    as NedX, a forum showcasing female authors. The Theater is housed within the Nederland
    Community Center.
- Kaleidoscope Gallery is Nederland’s primary fine art gallery. They display the work of over 30
    local artists and host seasonal shows and classes. Kaleidoscope is heavily involved in the arts
    community in Nederland and offers local artists a place to sell work commercially in town.
- Peak to Peak Music Education Association is a non-profit organization founded in 2011. Their
    mission is to raise money for local kids’ music programs by hosting musical events in the area.
    Their support of child music education strengthens the overall music community. This organization
    plays a key role in organizing NedFest, which is one of the events that helps fund their work with
    youth.

**_EXISTING EVENTS_**

- NedFest is a popular event in Nederland. 2023 was the first year NedFest came back to
    Nederland, after a long break starting in 2018 due to a lack of space at the prior venue, Barker
    Meadows Park. Now the festival is hosted at the Caribou Room and is officially titled “NedFest
    Family Reunion.” NedFest is a family-friendly music festival with live performances, food trucks,
    artist booths for all ages, and craft breweries for anyone over 21.
- NederDays is an annual festival celebrating the culture and community of Nederland. Previous
    activities have included barn dances, a silent disco, a sledding course and competition, a snowy 5K
    run, ice carving, and a wood chopping competition. NederDays is an inclusive event for families
    focused on celebrating local businesses and community members.
- High Peaks Art Festival is an annual outdoor art festival held each summer in Nederland. Artists
    are invited to exhibit original fine art in a variety of mediums, and the show is juried to ensure
    quality. Organizers of the event focus on marketing to art connoisseurs from Colorado’s Front
    Range community, inviting them to explore the arts and crafts of the high country. The High Peaks
    Art Festival provides an excellent opportunity for mountain artists to connect with art collectors.
- 4th Fridays are an ongoing event that invites tenants of Caribou Village Shopping Center to
    collaborate each 4th Friday during the summer months to provide an interactive evening of live
    music, artist demonstrations, specials, and snacks.
- Ned Ned Trailfest is a running series that promotes fundraising for Teens Inc. and features three
    different race options, a 5K, 10K, and half marathon. The race routes go through Old Town
    Nederland, and along dirt roads, and single-track trails in Nederland. Ned Ned is a 42-year-old
    running tradition that brings many runners both in and outside of Nederland together and has won
    Elevation Outdoors Best of the Rockies in 2016 and 2017.

**_VISITOR CENTER_**

Nederland’s Visitor Center serves as an important resource for managing and enhancing the town’s
tourism economy. Strategically located to provide information on area attractions, including outdoor
recreation, cultural sites, local restaurants, and retail options, the center plays a crucial role in orienting
visitors and enhancing their experience in Nederland. As the town looks to refine its approach to
tourism management, there is a shift toward reducing the emphasis on merchandise sales and focusing
more on providing relevant and timely information. This shift is aligned with the town’s broader goals
of sustainable tourism, ensuring that visitors are well-informed about local offerings while supporting
the preservation of Nederland’s unique character and natural environment. Continuing to invest in the
Visitor Center is essential for managing the impacts of tourism while promoting the town’s cultural and
natural assets responsibly.

**ENGAGEMENT SUMMARY**

**_WHAT WAS HEARD_**

When community members were asked what types of businesses they would like to see more of in
Nederland, the top choices were pharmacies, local food provisions, and childcare. Several other specific
gaps in business offerings were identified during the conversation: Car wash, medical services, glamping
operation, auto mechanic, urgent care, printing shop, packaging shop, makers space, auto-parts store,
housewares, bank, childcare, dentists, and lodging.

When asked about the kinds of economic development objectives that should be prioritized, Open
House attendees generally favored pursuing land use changes that would grow Nederland’s tax base and
support the development of high-quality commercial space to attract new business types. Online survey
respondents, however, preferred investing in streetscape design/active transportation and leveraging
natural and recreational amenities to encourage tourism-related economic development. Several
respondents wrote in comments regarding the need to annex certain areas like Cold Springs and Ridge
Rd. to increase the tax base. Notably, very few respondents said they wanted to improve the visibility of
Nederland to visitors through destination marketing.


**104 Comprehensive Plan** 2024 **Update**

```
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STAKEHOLDER MEETING
The economic development stakeholder meeting yielded several critical insights into the needs and
opportunities for the local economy. The primary theme was the cost of housing, which makes it
difficult to sustain a workforce or attract critical community positions. A lot of Nederland’s business
owners live in Gilpin County, not in Nederland; Nederland is unaffordable for them and their
employees. This lack of affordability is a threat to the culture of Nederland and could drive out locals.
Another common issue identified was issues with infrastructure in the downtown, including poor quality
commercial space and the lack of sidewalks. This group confirmed that sidewalks are a top priority for
the town and the DDA.
```
```
Another gap identified by the stakeholder group was a lack of classic economic and business
development services/organizations. For example, there are no business support services, business or
innovation incubators, or organizations focused on building skills in the workforce. Teens, inc. comes
the closest to these services, offering some programs that train youth and connect them to employment
opportunities.
```
```
ARTS AND CULTURE STAKEHOLDER MEETING
During our arts and culture stakeholder meeting, several attendees shared the sentiment that Nederland
strongly values arts and felt that the town provides a supportive environment with funding and
collaboration. A few prominent needs/opportunities emerged from the conversation. A major theme
was the importance of events, especially those featuring live performances. Events are popular because
they bring cultural experiences to residents, but there are problems with a lack of clear protocol
as well as infrastructural issues with signage, parking, transportation access, venue, and overnight
accommodation. Stakeholders all agreed it is important to view arts and culture as including music,
theater, visual arts, cultural celebration, and history.
```
```
Another common theme was the desire for an arts district, with potential benefits for funding and
brand identity. There was a related conversation about the NDDA boundary. Some stakeholders
recommended that the NDDA redraw its boundary to be inclusive of key institutions like The
Community Center, the Caribou Room, and the Wildbear Nature Center, so they can access funding
for public art projects.
```
```
When asked about the important elements of history and culture in Nederland, the primary themes
brought up included the history of music and music recording (especially blue grass and rock),
indigenous culture and heritage, and mining history. Several individuals felt these historical elements
should be prioritized in public art, and featured in events, such as the idea that the Steam Shovel from
the mining museum should be run to celebrate mining culture at town events.

## Vision Statement

```
“Nederland thrives with a healthy, diversified, long-term-sustainable
economy that prioritizes the needs of its citizens while protecting honoring,
and benefitting from its precious natural setting.”
```
## Objectives & Strategies

Several of the economic development-related recommendations are closely intertwined with
recommendations identified in the Land Use, Transportation, and Housing chapters of this
comprehensive plan as well as the Downtown Subarea Plan.

OBJECTIVE 1:
**Diversify Local Business Offerings to Meet Resident Needs**

Nederland’s proximity to outdoor recreation access, scenic setting, and quirky,
artistic atmosphere has historically advantaged businesses that can draw visitors
and tourists such as food and beverage establishments, and retail shops. These business types account
for 63.6% of businesses in Nederland. Despite this, a significant priority identified in community and
stakeholder engagement is the need to add core businesses in Nederland. Several business types are
missing from Nederland, requiring residents to go to larger markets (primarily Boulder and online
services) to fulfill those needs. While Nederland may be too small to support the full-time establishment
of some core business types, there is an economic cost to not supporting a diverse array of businesses
in town in the form of “leakage” or the tendency to spend additional dollars on goods and services in
an area where you go for work, or appointments such as dental visits. When residents commute to
Boulder or another Front Range community to access a dentist, it is not uncommon for them to also
do their shopping for clothing, groceries, haircuts, or other goods and services in the same community
where their appointments or primary “draw” is located. There is also a social and equity cost to not
having a diverse array of core services in town. As the population ages, and older adults make up a
larger share of the population, it will become increasingly important to maintain a network of core
services such as grocery stores, pharmacies, auto repair shops, medical services, etc. in a closer range of
access to folks with decreased mobility.

OBJECTIVE 2:
**Creative strategies for supporting local business
operations**

As noted in the Land Use chapter, there are opportunities
available to remove regulatory barriers that prevent small businesses from operating in areas outside of
commercial retail spaces, such as legalizing in-home childcare services. The areas zoned for commercial
retail establishments in Nederland are primarily focused around the downtown area, and the availability
of new retail or commercial space is limited and can be expensive. There may be opportunities in the
long run as new multi-family housing units are developed to leverage a mix of uses and add commercial
retail space to the ground floor of multi-family housing units, or to fill in more commercial businesses
in currently vacant or underutilized parcels. In the short term, and to support the potential for more
business offerings that meet the daily needs of residents, the town could examine ways to support
businesses that can operate out of homes, basements, garages, accessory structures, or ADUs by
removing regulatory restrictions and offering financial incentives to home-businesses.


**106 Comprehensive Plan** 2024 **Update**

```
OBJECTIVE 3:
Prioritize Public Investments in the Public Realm
```
```
Large swaths of the economic core of Nederland, downtown,
and adjacent neighborhoods, have aging public infrastructure and
disconnected, inaccessible sidewalks that connect residents to
Downtown. New public and private development could help improve Downtown infrastructure through
impact fees or exactions that would require developers to build sidewalks or make improvements to the
public realm adjacent to the new development which could help make downtown more accessible and
desirable for residents to access existing and new businesses. There has been a strong interest among
stakeholders and community members in having more locally serving businesses. Providing better access
from residential portions of town to the economic core may spur new business interest in Nederland.
The Nederland Multimodal Transportation Plan and Downtown Subarea Plan outline several specific
public realm improvements including identifying priority sidewalk improvements, new circulation
patterns on downtown streets, and ways of increasing multimodal connectivity to and through
downtown. Implementing the recommendations from these plans will help the Town of Nederland
achieve the objective of prioritizing municipal investment in the public realm.
```
```
OBJECTIVE 4:
Leverage Partnerships Between Businesses and Cultural and
Recreational Events
```
```
The Town of Nederland is fortunate to have a diverse range of cultural
and recreational event offerings year-round. Leveraging these events, and other natural and cultural
resources to find opportunities for enhancing the economic condition in Nederland will benefit both
the business community to throw events, increase public arts and culture offerings, and collaborate on
projects that increase the visibility and desirability of Downtown.
```
```
OBJECTIVE 5:
Maintain and Enhance Key Community Facilities Including the
Visitor Center.
```
```
Following strategies from the Utilities chapter, Nederland will prioritize the
renovation and expansion of key community facilities. The Visitor Center will continue to serve as a hub
for managing tourism, with a focus on offering useful information and reducing emphasis on merchandise
sales. Seeking grant funding for facility upgrades will be a critical part of this strategy, ensuring that these
spaces remain welcoming and functional for both residents and visitors.

**STRATEGIES**

1. Implement Recommendations from The Downtown Subarea plan: The Downtown Subarea Plan
    highlights the opportunity to increase business diversity downtown, and what types of businesses
    fit the identified downtown character areas. Since downtown Nederland is the economic center of
    town, following these guidelines for new development and redevelopment opportunities along with
    opportunities to support existing businesses.
2. Implement Recommendations from the Nederland Tourism Management Strategy: The Nederland
    Tourism Management Strategy (NTMS) serves as a framework for managing and responsibly
    promoting tourism in Nederland and the surrounding area. The purpose of the strategy is to
    provide a three-year roadmap for the Town of Nederland and its community partners to actively
    engage in tourism management and improve communications with visitors. The overall aim is to
    generate visitor spending and enhance travel experiences while preserving the town’s cultural
    heritage and environment. The NTMS identifies six goals aligned with Nederland’s 2030 vision
    focused on responsible tourism management. Each goal is supported by specific strategies, actions,
    recommended partners, resources, and a timeline, along with Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to
    track progress. The goals identified in the NTMS are listed below, and greater detail on the specific
    strategies and actions associated with goals can be found in the NTMS report.
3. Wayfinding and Signage: During the stakeholder feedback sessions, participants expressed that
    the town was lacking in wayfinding signage that oriented visitors to key nodes and destinations in
    Nederland. As the Town of Nederland and the NDDA continue to invest in sidewalk infrastructure
    and plan for bicycle and pedestrian connections to Downtown, and important consideration will
    be the development of a branded wayfinding signage plan that will orient visitors and residents to

key nodes and destinations in town. Further, this recommendation builds upon a recommended
action from the NTMS. To increase capture of tourist travel along the Peak-to-Peak Highway, or
coming to Nederland from Boulder, the town should consider investing in a well-designed suite of
vehicular-oriented roadway guide signs that orient visitors to key nodes and destinations in town, so
that folks that are “traveling through” are more likely to linger. Signs used for vehicular orientation
must comply with roadway signage standards and guidelines that are regulated by State, County, or
Municipal transportation departments, however, the bicycle and pedestrian wayfinding signs that
are not installed along roadways are less restricted by such standards, and pose an opportunity to
partner with local artists, or schools groups to come up with a theme and branding to elevate the
image of the town, and show-off the creative culture of Nederland.
```
4. Prioritize Parking and Sidewalk Improvements: Prioritize parking improvements (such as
    recommendations found in Nederland’s 2010 Parking Study and the recommendations from the
    2024 Multimodal Transportation Plan), including centralized parking “pods” along the outskirts of
    downtown that encourage people to get out of their car and explore Nederland’s businesses and
    amenities. An example could include reclaiming the area adjacent to the “Welcome to Nederland”
    sign as a potential parking pod. The Town of Nederland should also continue to identify future
    opportunities to improve pedestrian and drainage improvements throughout the town, including
    paving existing crusher fins paths that resulted from the “NedPeds” Plan that is currently (2012-
    2014). Further, implement sidewalk improvements pertaining to 2nd Street as a connection between
    the Library, Post Office, and transit stops, specifically. Continue to promote improvements to
    pathways for non-motorized circulation, consistent with the Trails Master Plan, as well as pedestrian
    improvements throughout the central Business District. Continue to explore the potential for a
    connected trail system along Barker Reservoir’s perimeter eventually connecting Big Springs with
    the central Business District.
5. Colorado Main Streets Program: The Colorado Main Street Program is administered by the Division
    of Local Government within the Colorado Department of Local Affairs and offers support for
    community-led downtown revitalization. The goal of Colorado Main Streets is to assist communities
    across the State committed to creating high-quality places and to building stronger communities
    through preservation-based economic development. Communities can apply to be an affiliated Min
    Street Community through Colorado Main Streets. Official Main Street communities receive a
    full range of technical assistance, training, consulting services, mini grants (ranging from $2,500 to
    $10,000 annually), and scholarships. The application requires you to have a steering committee or
    board of directors, volunteers or staff who have reviewed the Main Street Approach, a dedicated
    champion to act as a point of contact, a strategic plan, community awareness, and support from
    the public and private sectors. The Main Street: Open for Business Grant Program, enabled by
    Senate Bill 21-252, awarded money to eligible entities (municipalities, counties, and councils of
    government), to provide incentive programs for local business owners to improve the energy
    efficiency and/or aesthetics of commercial buildings within traditional downtowns. This program was
    designed to increase property values and visual appeal, increase sales and revenues in rehabilitated
    buildings, reduce energy consumption and lower utility bills, and increase job retention/creation.
    The Town could consider affiliating as a Main Street Community to unlock funding and technical
    assistance from the Division of Local Government in order to catalyze new economic development
    opportunities in Downtown Nederland.

**110 Comprehensive Plan** 2024 **Update**

6. Import-replacement Tactics: The concept of “import-replacement” was coined by Jane Jacobs
    in her seminal book “Cities and The Wealth of Nations”. Import-replacement is where locals
    constantly seek to provide for themselves the things they currently bring in (import) from outside
    the community. Opportunities for the town to support the organic adoption of import-replacement
    tactics in Nederland could include removing restrictions placed on uses in all residential zone
    districts pertaining to home-based businesses such as in-home childcare as discussed in the Land Use
    chapter. Other examples of in-home businesses that could be allowed by right include, but are not
    limited to, salons, barbers, auto mechanics, bike repair services, veterinary or other domestic animal
    care related services such as pet grooming and day care. Allowing these services that could be done
    from someone’s home, or an accessory structure on their property such as a garage, could allow for
    a greater diversity of service offerings locally without the need to grow existing commercial space
    to accommodate these services in the short run. In the short run, the town could benefit greatly by
    allowing residents the opportunity to find additional services locally without needing to commute
    to Boulder or other Front Range communities to access childcare, see a vet, or have their bike
    repaired. Over time, as business grows, or a large enough demand takes hold in the community,
    some of these in-home services could grow to accommodate new commercial space in town, which
    will benefit the long-run growth of sales tax revenue.
7. Hire a Town Grants Coordinator: The town does not currently have a staff person whose primary
    job responsibilities include searching for and applying for grant funding. The responsibility of finding
    grant funding is currently divided amongst town staff who have several other responsibilities
    beyond filling out grant applications. Grant funding is typically highly competitive with several local
    governments, non-profit organizations, and quasi-governmental organizations – such as special
    districts – all competing for the same sources of State and Federal funding opportunities released as
    competitive grants. Competing for grant funding with other communities and organizations that have
    personnel dedicated to finding and applying for grant funding can hamstring Nederland’s ability to
    rely on grants as a source of revenue year-over-year as others are able to dedicate more personnel
    resources into the grant application which increases their chances of being awarded funding. The
    Town of Nederland could consider hiring a staff person whose sole responsibility is searching for
    and applying for grant funding. To be sensitive to the costs of adding new personnel, the town could
    explore starting the Grants Coordinator on a seasonal, limited term, or part-time basis then grow
    the position into a full-time role over time if the opportunity cost of increased grant funding awards
    outweighs the costs of adding a full-time staffer to the town’s payroll.
8. Explore Creative Funding Strategies: The Town of Nederland should endeavor to achieve a
    sustainable, diversified economy by exploring alternative economic opportunities, and forms of
    municipal funding for the community. The Town of Nederland is not alone in their need to diversify
    their revenue stream. Several Colorado communities, especially mountain towns proximate to
    outdoor recreation amenities, are heavily reliant on sales tax revenue to support public services and
    the development and maintenance of public infrastructure such as roads and sidewalks. In recent
    years, Nederland has been able to secure large amounts of grant funding, which is a great source
    of revenue for capital budgeting, however, as discussed in previous sections of this chapter, grant
    funding is not a sustainable source of revenue in the long-term and cannot be used for maintenance
    of existing infrastructure. The Town of Nederland collects tax revenue through sales, property, use,
    marijuana, and other taxes/fees. Tax and fee collection is not sufficient to meet the town’s current
    obligations for maintenance, and provision of public services when coupled with the need to add
    new infrastructure such as new sidewalks, bike infrastructure, or parking facilities, and the need to
    add additional service capacity such as expanding the service offering of the Nederland Community
    Center. Below are examples of strategies for allowing tax revenue to go further by finding additional
    sources of revenue or funding to dedicate to certain portions of the town’s fiscal obligations and
    priorities.


```
Economic Development & Arts + Culture 111

- To allow tax revenue to go further in maintaining existing public infrastructure and providing
    public services, the Town could find creative ways to leverage federal transportation dollars to
    put towards capital projects such as engaging with the State’s Infrastructure Bank (SIB). SIBs are
    revolving infrastructure investment funds for surface transportation projects that are established
    and administered by states. SIBs can offer loans (at much lower rates than private lending
    institutions) to invest in surface transportation projects. The town could leverage this funding
    source for improvements, such as new parking infrastructure or capacity improvements along
    major roadways connecting the Town such as Hwy 119 and Hwy 72.
- The Town of Nederland is fiscally reliant on visitors purchasing goods and services in town. Sales
    taxes continue to be the town’s highest source of ongoing revenue. The Town of Nederland is
    an amenity community, with its proximity to the Eldora Ski Area, and several State, County, and
    Federal public lands. Given is an amenity community, Nederland is in a unique position where the
    town must balance providing services for visitors, who in peak seasons can outnumber residents,
    while conserving public amenities and infrastructure to meet the needs of residents. Sales taxes
    are applied to all commercial businesses in the town and are paid by tourists and residents alike.
    To capture more specific revenue from tourism and the key economic drivers of skiing and
    public lands and the associated restaurant, lodging, and amenity businesses that cater to tourist
    traffic, the town could consider adding a resort tax. A resort tax is an additional sales tax that is
    levied on lodging, restaurants, bars, and destination ski or recreation facilities. Missoula, Montana
    recently put in place a resort tax to leverage the high tourist traffic that they see, and better
    reflect the additional sales tax revenue of tourist-dependent businesses to pay for the outsized
    impact on public infrastructure and services that tourism brings. There are several advantages to
    a resort tax, first, the revenue raised locally gets reinvested locally in a manner determined by
    voters. Second, revenue is raised largely by tourist spending, ensuring that visitors fund programs
    that conserve the amenities and offset the impacts of visitors on the community. However, the
    benefits of this mechanism are limited to the places narrowly identified as resort communities.
    This means that the counties surrounding these communities, which provide public safety
    services like search and rescue, cannot levy a tax on visitor spending.^2
- Priority-based budgeting is a budgeting strategy that focuses on allocating funds based on
    community needs and priorities focused on the level of programs and services instead of line
    items or departments. Like zero-based budgeting, priority-based budgets begin with a clean
    slate, putting all funds on the table, rather than working from an existing model. This allows each
    program or initiative to be evaluated with a fresh pair of eyes, leading to funding decisions that
    better meet community needs. Priority-based budgeting direct funding towards higher-value
    or higher priority services and programs and scales back or eliminates lower-value programs
    and services, this building in an on-going evaluation and feedback process so that the town
    can ensure that limited dollars are being spent on the key community priorities to ensure that
    funding is aligned with the town’s values. Other amenity rich communities such as Duluth, MN
    and Roanoke, VA, with limited funding have had successes transitioning their municipal funding
    structure to the priority-based budgeting system.
9. Create an Arts + Culture District: Like the creation and ongoing provision of the Nederland
Downtown Development Authority (DDA) which provides a dedicated lens and funding to
Downtown, the town could consider the creation of an Arts + Culture District, which could have
the authority to levy taxes and raise funding to support arts, and cultural events in town. This could
be used to support afterschool arts and cultural programs at the Nederland Community Center,
provide increased awareness and marketing for historical and cultural centers in town such as the

**112 Comprehensive Plan** 2024 **Update**

```
Nederland Mining Museum, and could commission public art pieces in town to beautify and enhance
the public realm for residents and visitors. Further, the Arts + Culture District could provide
structure and an umbrella of planning and coordination between cultural events in town to oversee
the coordination and planning for impacts on the town amenities such as parking, circulation by
working to mitigate impacts and creating a cohesive information campaign to give residents ample
notice of upcoming events and any impacts that may be associated with them.
```
10. Visitor Center Management: Create a plan to review the vision and operating conditions for the
    Visitor Center, emphasizing information services and reducing the emphasis on merchandise sales.
    Ensure that the center provides relevant and updated information for tourists and visitors. Should
    the town also explore an Arts + Culture District, funding raised from the District could go towards
    upkeep of the Visitor Center and the Visitor Center could be used as a resource for marketing, and
    communicating upcoming events and provide tourists and visitors with the knowledge to expand
    upon their time in Nederland to go beyond recreation and explore the town’s creative arts, culture,
    and historical amenities.
11. Explore Opportunities for More Resident-Focused Events: The Town of Nederland is fortunate to
    host several cultural, recreational, and artistic events in town throughout the year. These events can
    be a great boon to local businesses and contribute positively to the vibrancy of the Town through
    increased visitation. Larger events do come with tradeoffs in that there can be circulation and
    logistical impacts to the everyday residents, and the “activation” of people in town is very high for
    1-2 days, then falls off to normal patterns immediately following the event. The Nederland Tourism
    Management Strategy (NTMS) states that “Today, Nederland focuses on community-based tourism,
    investing in activities that benefit both visitors and residents”. To build on that sentiment outlined
    in the NTMS, the town should foster more regular interaction between Nederland residents and
    aspire to create regular habits of using public spaces for local happenings and small-scale events.
    The Town of Nederland could work with local organizations like Teens Inc. or Mountain Peak
    Life, schools, businesses, and community members in support of this goal. The primary audience of
    these happenings would be residents; however, they should be open and available to people passing
    through or who “happen to be in town”. Such happenings could look like weekly run clubs that start
    at a local brewery and end with a celebratory pint, or weekly art in Chipita Park, outdoor chess on
    Mainstreet once a week, or a monthly block party with sidewalk chalk, food, and music. The town’s
    involvement in fostering these more regular happenings and occurrences should be in the form of
    making it easy to use public spaces for regular happenings, and where appropriate provide facilities
    like the library or Nederland Community Center and public infrastructure that supports the organic
    adoption of these happenings, such as additional picnic tables in the park, or the monthly closure of
    a street to automotive traffic to allow for monthly neighborhood block parties, etc., then quickly
    allow residents, community organizations, and local businesses to fill in with the programming or
    organization of more regular happenings in town.

# 10 Implementation

**114 Comprehensive Plan** 2024 **Update**


## Implementation

```
This planning process was a collaborative effort between Town staff, the Planning Commission, the
Board of Trustees, various Town boards, and Nederland residents. These parties have contributed
substantial thought and effort into the vision, objectives, and strategies laid out in the previous chapters
of this plan. To help realize the intended outcomes of this plan, this chapter summarizes the objectives
and strategies and highlights responsible entities, strategic partnerships, and the timing and level of
complexity assumed for each.
```
```
While the following implementation tables provide a series of strategies the Town could take to fulfill
each objective, it is recognized that new opportunities, funding sources, technologies, and partnerships
could arise. The Town should consider these new opportunities with the Vision and Objectives for each
topic area in mind, and assess how they may contribute to the overall intent. It is also recognized that
Nederland has fewer staff and financial resources compared to many larger metropolitan areas, elevating
the importance of regional collaboration and resource sharing.
```
```
Note: The “Timing” column outlines Short-term, Medium-term, Long-term, and Ongoing strategies.
Short-term (0-2 years), Medium-term (2-4 years), and Long-term (4+ years).
